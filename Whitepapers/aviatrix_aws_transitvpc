Overview
========

Aviatrix is a next generation cloud networking solution built from the
ground up for the public cloud. It simplifies the way you enable site to
cloud, user to cloud and cloud to cloud secure connectivity and access.
The Aviatrix solution requires no new hardware and deploys in minutes.

This configuration guide provides step by step instruction on how to
build a highly available AWS Transit VPC. Below is an architecture
diagram of what a general AWS Transit VPC deployment looks like, where a
Hub VPC (or Transit VPC) connects many Spoke VPCs to facilitate
communication between Spoke VPC and on-prem network.

Aviatrix Solution Key Benefits
==============================

**Simplicity.** Centrally managed, point and click solution deploys in
minutes.

**Highly Available.** Built-in gateway redundancy supports hot standby
and fail over in seconds.

**Cost Saving.** If hub and spoke VPCs are in the same region, encrypted
traffic is routed over AWS peering, reducing network bandwidth cost by
10 times (comparing to AWS Transit VPC solution that goes over Internet
with VGW for hub and spoke traffic).

**Scalable.** The solution does not require a unique public IP address
on the hub gateway connecting to each spoke gateway. No limits on the
number of spoke VPCs can be connected to hub VPC.

**Visibility.** Central dashboard monitors, displays and alerts link
status and link latency.

**Additional Benefits.** Stateful firewall at the gateway to enforce
security policies. OpenVPN based user access allows end to end cloud
network solution. For more details, visit www.aviatrix.com.

Pre Configuration Checklist
===========================

Before configuring user VPC peering, make sure the following is
completed.\
\
**Pre Configuration Check List**

1.  Deploy the Aviatrix Controller

2.  Check VPC Settings

These prerequisites are explained in detail below.

Deploy the Aviatrix Controller
------------------------------

The Aviatrix Controller must be deployed and setup prior to configuring
VPC and site peering. Please reference the Aviatrix Controller getting
started guide for AWS on how to deploy the Aviatrix Controller.

[Aviatrix Controller Getting Started
Guide](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-download/docs/aviatrix_aws_controller_gsg.pdf)

Check and make sure you can access the Aviatrix Controller dashboard and
login with an administrator account. The default URL for the Aviatrix
Controller is:

https://&lt;public ip of Aviatrix Controller&gt;

Check VPC Settings
------------------

-   The VPC must have at least one public subnet to deploy the gateway.
    This means one subnet must be associated with a route table that has
    an IGW as its default route.

-   If your hub VPC and spoke VPC are in the same region and you like to
    route the traffic over AWS peering, go to AWS console and configure
    the necessary AWS peering between the two VPCs.

Configuration Steps
===================

Make sure the pre-configuration steps in the previous section is
completed before proceeding.

The instructions in this section will use the following architecture.
The CIDR and subnets may vary depending on your VPC setup; however, the
general principals will be the same.

In this example we have three VPCs: Transit VPC, spoke VPC in US-WEST1
and spoke VPC in US-EAST1. The corporate data center is located in
California. The system will be configured such that all spoke nodes and
sites will be able to communicate with each other via the transit VPC.

Step 1 – Deploy Gateways
------------------------

The first step is to deploy Aviatrix gateways in each VPC.

**Instructions:**

1.  Login to the Aviatrix Controller Console

2.  Click on Gateway -&gt; Create

  **Setting**     **Value**
  --------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  Cloud Type      Choose AWS
  Account Name    Choose the account name
  Region          Choose the region where your VPC is located
  VPC ID          Choose the VPC
  Gateway Name    This name is arbitrary (ex. gw01)
  Public Subnet   Select a public subnet where the gateway will be deployed
  Gateway Size    t2.micro is fine for testing.
  Enable NAT      Uncheck this box
  VPN Access      Uncheck this box

1.  Click “Create”. It will take a few minutes for the gateway to
    deploy. Do not proceed until the gateway is deployed.

2.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the additional 2 VPCs in this example.

3.  Done

Step 2 – Connect Spoke VPC to Transit VPC
-----------------------------------------

This step explains how to connect a spoke VPC to the transit VPC.

**Instructions:**

1.  From the Aviatrix Controller Console

2.  Click VPC/VNet -&gt; Encrypted Peering -&gt; Encrypted Peering.

3.  Click Add

4.  Select the VPC1 (transit) gateway and VPC2 (spoke 1) gateway for the
    peering

    Note: If the two VPCs are in the same region, you can check the box
    “over AWS Peering”. This would allow the encrypted peering to route
    traffic over native AWS peering, resulting in 10 times bandwidth
    saving.

5.  Click Add

6.  Select the VPC1 (transit) gateway and VPC3 (spoke 2) gateway for the
    peering and then click Add

7.  Done

Step 3 – Connect Corporate Data Center to Transit VPC
-----------------------------------------------------

This step explains how to connect the corporate data center to the
transit VPC

**Instructions:**

1.  From the Aviatrix Controller Console

2.  Click VPC/VNet -&gt; Site2Cloud - &gt;Add

  **Setting**                    **Value**
  ------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------
  VPC ID/VNet Name               Choose Transit VPC ID
  Gateway                        Choose Transit VPC gateway
  Connection Name                This name is arbitrary (ex. corpdatacenter)
  Customer Gateway IP Address:   Public IP address of the terminating device at the corp datacenter
  Customer Network               10.3.0.0/16 (in this example)
  Private Route Encryption       Uncheck
  Cloud Subnet                   10.0.0.0/16, 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16 (in this example)
  Null Encryption                Uncheck

1.  Click Add

2.  Click List, select the Transit VPC ID and then click Run

3.  Put a check mark next to your “Connection Name” (from above) and
    then click download

4.  If your terminating device is a Cisco ASA, select ASA, otherwise,
    select Generic.

5.  This template file contains the necessary information to configure
    the terminating device at the corp data center. Once the terminating
    device is configured, the tunnel will automatically come up.

6.  Done

Step 4 – Configure Transitive Routing
-------------------------------------

This step explains how to configure transitive routing so that every
spoke and site node can communicate with each other via the transit VPC.

**Instructions:**

1.  From the Aviatrix Controller Console

2.  Click VPC/VNet -&gt; Encrypted Peering -&gt; Transitive Peering

    a.  For VPC2 (spoke 1) select:

        i.  Click Add

        ii. Source VPC: VPC2, Next Hop VPC: VPC1 (transit), Destination
            CIDR: 10.2.0.0/16

        iii. Click Add and then Add again

        iv. Source VPC: VPC2, Next Hop VPC: VPC1 (transit), Destination
            CIDR: 10.3.0.0/16

        v.  Click Add

    b.  For VPC3 (spoke 2) select:

        i.  Click Add

        ii. Source VPC: VPC3, Next Hop VPC: VPC1 (transit), Destination
            CIDR: 10.1.0.0/16

        iii. Click Add and then Add again

        iv. Source VPC: VPC3, Next Hop VPC: VPC1 (transit), Destination
            CIDR: 10.3.0.0/16

        v.  Click Add

3.  Done

Appendix – Terminating on VGW
=============================

The Aviatrix transit VPC solution also supports terminating on AWS VGWs
in the spoke VPC. In this case, the AWS VGWs must be manually setup in
each spoke VPC.
