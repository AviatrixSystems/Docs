Test Drive CloudN on Your Laptop 
***********************************

CloudN can be installed on your laptop and test driven for evaluation purposes. 
It runs on VMware Workstation, VMware Player, Fusion and virtual box. 

Download CloudN Images
#######################

Follow `these instructions <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/CloudN-Startup-Guide.html>`_ to download CloudN image.


Test Drive CloudN in NAT Mode 
#################################

One good configuration to test drive cloudN is to deploy it on your
laptop on a private subnet in NAT mode (In Hyper-V, the network adapters
are configured as Internal Network Wire).

As an example, if your NAT mode subnet is 192.168.10.0/24, you can
create a maximum of 2 VPCs from CloudN deployed on this subnet. Suppose the
default gateway IP address is 192.168.10.2. You should configure CloudN to 
take 192.168.10.3 as its IP address. 

In addition, CloudN reserves IP
address ranges from 192.168.10.4 to 192.168.10.7. (If you have other VMs
running on this subnet, if their IP address fall in the same sub
segment as CloudN, you can use one of these VMs as test VM.)

Once you launch VPCs from this CloudN, the other VMs on the
subnet should be able to run SSH, RDP, and SCP (file copy) to any
instances in VPCs using the instance private IP address seamlessly,
without any bastion station or landing VPC. Refer to How It Works
section for more explanations.

.. Note:: If you install CloudN on a NAT subnet, make sure both Ethernet interfaces are changed to NAT mode (By default, CloudN is pre-configured and shipped with both Network Adapters in Bridged mode). Right click on the CloudN VM, click Settings. Change both Network Adapters to NAT mode, as shown below for the VMware Workstation:

|image23|

Test Drive on MAC with VMware Fusion
------------------------------------

After downloading the zip file and decompressing it, copy the folder to
a location where your Mac can access it. Perform the following steps to
install CloudN.

**Step 1**: From the VMware Fusion menu bar, select File > Import.

|image24|

**Step 2**: The Import Library window appears, along with a dialog box for
browsing to the location of OVF file.

|image25|

**Step 3**: Browse to the .ovf file and click open

|image26|

**Step 4**: Type the name of the imported virtual machine in the Save
As text box and indicate where to save it.

|image27|

**Step 5**: After the import is complete, the virtual machine appears in the
virtual machine library. Click on “Start Up” to start the CloudN virtual
machine.

|image28|

**Step 6**: Change Network Adapters to NAT mode

Select the VM, click Settings, click Network Adapter, select “\ **Share
with my Mac**\ ”, as shown below

|image29|

Test Drive on PC with VMware Workstation
-----------------------------------------

Click on File -> Open, as shown below.

|image30|

Then open the desired VM.

|image31|

Highlight the VM, right click, select Settings, click on Network
Adapters, change both Network Adapter to NAT mode as shown below.

|image32|

Test Drive on VirtualBox
------------------------

CloudN works on VirtualBox only in a bridged mode.

After downloading and extracting the zip file, copy the folder to a
location where you can import the virtual machine. For installation,
follow the steps below.

**Step 1**: From the VirtualBox menu bar, select File > Import Appliance

|image33|

**Step 2**: Navigate to the CloudN ovf file and click “Next”

|image34|

**Step 3**: In the next screen, click on “Import” to start the import
process and wait for it to finish.

|image35|

**Step 4**: CloudN virtual machine installation is finished. It can be
launched by selecting it and clicking on the “Start” button.

|image36|

Configure Network Interfaces
-----------------------------

CloudN network interfaces should be configured in bridge mode as the NAT
mode makes it impossible for guests to communicate with each other. In
addition to this, both interfaces should be allowed to be in promiscuous
mode. Execute the steps below to satisfy these requirements.

Step 1: Select the CloudN VM and click on “Settings”

|image37|

Step 2: In the settings window, select “Network” and select "Bridged
Adapter" in the drop down list for the "Attached to" field.

|image38|

Step 3: Click on “Advanced” to reveal advanced configuration options and
select “Allow All” in the drop down list for “Promiscuous Mode” field.
Repeat this procedure for “Adapter 2” as well.

|image39|

Booting Up and Initial Configuration
#####################################

CloudN supports a browser based GUI Interface and REST APIs.

After the virtual machine boots up, you must first log in to the
machine while still in hypervisor console.

**CloudN Login User Name: admin**

**CloudN Login Password: Aviatrix123#**

After this initial login, if you see the screen below:

|image40|

Follow the instruction to type “help” at the prompt.

|image41|

Follow the steps to go through the boot up process. You can type “help”
at any time to review the steps. Type “?” to view all available
commands. For each command, type “?” to view syntax and parameters.

Step 1: Setup Interface Address
-------------------------------

CloudN works by dividing the subnet where CloudN is deployed into
sub-segments where each sub-segment becomes the VPC/VNet CIDR in the
cloud. We recommend you deploy CloudN in its own subnet to maximize the
number of VPC/VNets you can create.

Statically assign CloudN IP address
------------------------------------

You can statically assign an IP address to CloudN. Choose this approach
if you use CloudN to connect to an existing VPC. In the use case where
CloudN does not create a VPC and build an encrypted tunnel, CloudN does not
need to be deployed on a separate subnet.

Command: setup\_interface\_static\_address

Syntax: setup\_interface\_static\_address [static\_ip\_address]
[net\_mask] [default\_gateway\_ip\_address]
[primary\_dns\_server\_ip\_address]
[secondary\_dns\_server\_ip\_address] [proxy {true\|false}]

Below is an example where there is no proxy server. In such case, CloudN
will configure the network interfaces, test Internet connectivity and
download the latest Aviatrix software.

|image42|

Proxy Configuration
--------------------

If there is a proxy server for Internet access, you must setup proxy
configuration on CloudN to pass traffic to proxy correctly. The following is
the necessary command.

command: setup\_network\_proxy

syntax: setup\_network\_proxy <action> <--http\_proxy> <--https\_proxy>

where action is “test” or “save”.

Example:

::

  setup\_network\_proxy test --http\_proxy http://10.30.0.3:3128
  --https\_proxy http://10.30.0.3:3128

  setup\_network\_proxy save --http\_proxy http://10.30.0.3:3128
  --https\_proxy http://10.30.0.3:3128

Note that after the proxy configuration is saved, CloudN VM will reboot to have
the proxy take effect.


Step 2: Display Interface Address
----------------------------------

|image45|

Now you can use the cloudN IP address as the URL to access the CloudN Manager
that manages CloudN.

Note: The hypervisor console has only limited CLI for the initial booting up
purposes. Once Aviatrix software is downloaded, full commands are
installed.

The user should use the GUI to access the CloudN Console.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If there are any error messages during installation, they are usually due to a
lack of Internet connectivity, an incorrect DNS server IP address or
unopened firewall ports. Type “?” to see all the commands that help you
troubleshoot.

Use the commands “\ ***ping***\ ” and “\ ***traceroute***\ ” to check out
Internet connectivity. Check your DNS server setting and consult your
network and server admin to determine the cause of routing failure.

After the connectivity issue is resolved, use the command
“download\_cloudn\_software” to continue installation and finish. Or you
can again type in the command setup\_interface\_address.

Use a Browser to Access CloudN
-------------------------------

CloudN has a built in CloudN Console that lets you run provisioning from
a browser.

Once IP address setup is complete, you can use any browser to type
https://<IP address of CloudN> and see a Login page.

|image46|

Login with:

User Name: **admin**

Password: **private IP address of the VM**

After logging, go through the initial setup process.

For the first time user and initial setup, follow Onboarding to go
through the initial set up and launch your first VPC/VNet.

Onboarding
#############

After you log in to the browser console, click Onboarding to go through a
few steps of initial setup and start creating the first VPC/VNet.

Once you log in, click on Help for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). All
features have descriptions and should be self-explanatory.
