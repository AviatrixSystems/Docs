The Aviatrix Controller provides a single pane of glass for all your secure networking tasks. You can run the Controller in your own VPC or let Aviatrix manage it in `our hosted service <https://www.aviatrix.com/trial/>`_.

The following guide applies to running the Controller in your own environment. 

The first thing you need to do is to launch the Controller instance. 

We'll walk you through 4 steps. By the end, you'll be 
ready for your first use case. 

  |4-steps|

You can also `watch a video <https://youtu.be/ltL_dWjjV0w>`_ for this startup guide. 

Before you start, you need to have an `AWS account <https://aws.amazon.com/>`__.   Create a new account or login to an existing IAM account.

.. Important::

    - We require this AWS IAM account to have permissions to create AWS IAM roles, IAM policies and launch EC2 instances. 
    - The Controller instance must be launched on a public subnet in a VPC. 
    - All AMIs should be launched by CloudFormation template provided by Aviatrix, as described in the next section.
..

.. tip::

  If the VPC where the Controller is deployed in has a custom DNS server (via DHCP option), make sure the Controller instance can reach this DNS server.  

..

Step 2. Launch the Controller with CloudFormation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you have subscribed to an AMI, you are ready to install the Controller instance.

Each Aviatrix AMI in AWS marketplace has a companion CloudFormation template. The template is used to launch the Controller instance. Clicking the subscribed AMI link below takes you to the CloudFormation page with the pre-loaded template.   

 - `Secure Networking Platform PAYG - Metered <https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/new?stackName=AviatrixController&templateURL=https:%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faviatrix-cloudformation-templates%2Faws-cloudformation-aviatrix-metering-controller.json?ref=_ptnr_docs_cta_meter_step2>`_

 - `Secure Networking Platform - Custom <https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/new?stackName=AviatrixController&templateURL=https:%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faviatrix-cloudformation-templates%2Favx-awsmp-5tunnel.template?ref=_ptnr_docs_cta_custom_step2>`_

 - `Cloud Interconnect BYOL <https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/new?stackName=AviatrixController&templateURL=https:%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Faviatrix-cloudformation-templates%2Favx-awsmp-BYOL.template?ref=_ptnr_docs_cta_byol_step2>`_
 
 - `Aviatrix User VPN – Metered <https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/new?stackName=AviatrixController&templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-cloudformation-templates/aws-cloudformation-aviatrix-user-vpn-metered.template?ref=_ptnr_docs_cta_vpn_metered_step2>`_
 

 2.1. If you have not logged in, you will be prompted to login to AWS console. 

 2.2. **Change to the Region** where you would like to install the Aviatrix Controller on the CloudFormation page. Note the CloudFormation is already loaded.

 2.3. Click `Next` as shown below:

 |cft-next|

 2.4. Fill in the following fields, 
  - the Stack name,
  - select a VPC in the drop down menu, 
  - select a public subnet in that VPC (Go to AWS VPC console to make sure the public subnet is indeed in your selected VPC. Read `this link  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html>`__ if you do not know what public subnet is.)
  - and a keypair (Read `how to create a keypair <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html>`_ to create a keypair in AWS EC2 console if this field is blank.)

   |imageCFSpecifyDetails|

.. note::

   The Aviatrix Controller must be launched on a public subnet. If this is the first time you launch Aviatrix Controller, select the default setting **New** for IAM Role Creation. If Aviatrix IAM role has been created before, select **aviatrix-role-ec2** for IAM Role Creation.  The Aviatrix Controller instance is termination protected. 
..

 2.5. Leave the `Controller Size` at `t2.large` and keep the `IAM role creation` at "New" unless you have already created the Aviatrix IAM roles.

 2.6. Click `Next`

 2.7. Optionally, add any key/value tags as required

 2.8. Optionally, select an IAM Role if your currently logged in user does not have permission to create instances.

 2.9. We recommend you to enable stack termination protection during stack creation time to prevent accidental deletion, as shown below, then click `Next`

  |imageCFEnableTermProtection|
     
.. Warning::

  The Controller instance has Termination Protection enabled. If you need to delete the stack, make sure you first disable the Controller instance Termination Protection at the AWS EC2 console.

..

 2.10. Click the checkbox next to "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation ..." and then click `Create`.

   |imageCFCreateFinal|

 2.11. Once the stack creation completes (Status change to `CREATE_COMPLETE`), click on the `Outputs` tab.  The values displayed will be needed when configuring primary access account in Aviatrix. (You might have to refresh your browser window and/or AWS console to see your Stack show up and the Status to be updated).
   
   |imageCFComplete|
   

.. note:: 

  Starting 01/15/2019, Aviatrix Quickstart Cloudformation stack deletions will not remove EIP or IAM resources (2 IAM roles & 2 IAM policies) which were aquired during stack creations. Users need to manually remove theses resources if they wish to do so.

..


Step 3. Connect to the Controller 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that Aviatrix Controller instance has been launched, let's login and go through a few init steps.

 3.1. Open a browser window to https://AviatrixControllerEIP, where AviatrixControllerEIP can be found in the Stack Outputs. You can also find the Controller instance EIP by going to AWS EC2 console, click the Controller instance and locate its public IP address. 

.. tip::
   You may receive a warning that the connection may not be secure.  This is because the certificate is self-signed by the Controller.  It is safe to continue to the page.

..

   |imageControllerBrowserWarning|

 3.2. Login with the username `admin`.

   For the password field, use the `AviatrixControllerPrivateIP`.  The `AviatrixControllerPrivateIP` can be found in the Outputs section of the CloudFormation stack. You can also find the Controller instance's private IP address by going to AWS EC2 console, click the Controller instance and locate its private IP address. 
   
   |imageCFOutputsWithPassword|

 3.3. Enter your email address.  This email will be used for alerts as well as password recovery (if needed).

   |imageControllerEnterEmail|

 3.4. Next, you will be prompted to change the admin password.

   |imageControllerChangePassword|

 3.5. Click `Skip` in the next page, unless the Controller instance VPC has an HTTP or HTTPS proxy configured for Internet access. 

   |imageproxy-config|

 3.6. Finally, the Controller will upgrade itself to the latest software version after you click on `Run`. Wait for a few minutes for the process to finish. 

   |imageControllerUpgrade|

.. tip::
   The Controller upgrade takes about 3-5 minutes.  Once complete, the login prompt will appear.  Use the user `admin` and your new password to login.

..

Step 4. Create A Primary Access Account 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

4.1 Select AWS 
---------------

Once logged back in to the Controller, you should be on the `Onboarding` page or click "Onboarding` on the navigation item. Then click AWS icon. 

   |imageOnboardAws|


4.2  (Only apply to BYOL AMI) Enter Your Customer ID 
-----------------------------------------------------

.. Note::

   This step only applies if you select BYOL AMI. Contact support@aviatrix.com to get a trial license if you do not have one.
..
   
Enter the `Customer ID` in the field and click `Save`.

   |imageEnterCustomerID|
   
4.3  Setup a Primary Access Account  
------------------------------------

The Aviatrix primary access account contains the following information:

  - The Controller instance's AWS 12 digit account ID.

Check out `this link <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/onboarding_faq.html#what-is-an-aviatrix-access-account-on-the-controller>`__ if you have questions regarding Aviatrix access account.

Fill out the fields as follows: (The AWS Account Number can be found at the Stack Outputs section or get from `this link. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html>`__)

  +-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
  | Field                         | Expected Value                             |
  +===============================+============================================+
  | Account Name                  | Enter a name that is unique on the         |
  |                               | Controller.                                |
  |                               | Example name: `AWSOpsTeam`.                |
  +-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
  | AWS Account Number            | The Controller instance's 12 digit         |
  |                               | AWS account number. It can be found in the |
  |                               | Stack Outputs section `AccoundId`.         |
  +-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
  | IAM role-based                | Check this box.                            |
  +-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

Once complete, click the `Create` button at the bottom of the form.
