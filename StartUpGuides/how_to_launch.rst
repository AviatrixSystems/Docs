How to Launch Aviatrix
=============================================

Aviatrix Secure Networking Platform consists of two components, Controller and
gateway. The Controller is launched first. From the Controller browser console, gateways are launched using your cloud account credentials with cloud provider APIs.


The Controller is launched and managed by you using AMI in your AWS account.  The Controller AMI is available in `AWS Marketplace, <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_  `Azure Marketplace <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/azure-aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_ and `GCloud <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/google-aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_.
