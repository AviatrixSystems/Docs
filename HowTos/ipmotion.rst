IPmotion Setup Instructions
=================================

Aviatrix IPmotion (IP Motion) is a technology that connects the same two subnets between on-prem and in the VPC. The technology is useful when migrating an on-prem VM to public cloud while preserving its IP address. It can also be used
for mission critical application HA to public cloud. 

The technology is described in the diagram below, where an on-prem VM with IP address 10.1.0.11 is migrated to AWS
while preserving its IP address. After migration, any on-prem VMs can continue to communicate with this migrated VM
as if it still resides on-prem. 

Note the actual migration process is not included in this document. We assume you have tools, for example, `AWS Migration Hub <https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/>`_ to migrate on-prem VMs to public cloud.

Prerequisites
--------------

 1. Identify an on-prem subnet where you plan to migrate VMs. For example, the subnet is 172.16.1.0/24.
 #.  Create a AWS VPC with a public subnet that has identical CIDR as the on-prem subnet where migration is to take place. For example, create a VPC 172.16.0.0/16 with a public subnet 172.16.1.0/24. Note the migrated EC2 instances do not need to take public IP addresses.  

 #. Deploy Aviatrix virtual appliance CloudN in the on-premise subnet.  Read `this document <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/CloudN-Startup-Guide.html>`_ on how to deploy the virtual appliance. AWS reserves `five IP addresses <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#vpc-sizing-ipv4>`__ on a given subnet, make sure CloudN IP address is not any one of them. For example on a 172.16.1.0/24 subnet, 172.16.1.0-172.16.1.3 and 172.16.1.255 are reserved. 

 #. Once the virtual appliance is deployed, go through on-boarding process and create an AWS account. 

 #. Take an inventory of IP addresses of all running VMs and unused IP addresses on this subnet, as shown in the example below.

.. note::
   For description purpose, a migrated VM that has the same IP address as its on-prem VM is called the migrated EC2 instance.

Login to the CloudN Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open a browser and navigate to `https://<cloudN IP address>/`.  Once authenticated, click on `IP Motion` in the left navigation bar.

Follow the steps below to set up `IP Motion` for the selected subnet.


1. Specify on-Prem IP Address List
-------------------------------------------

The `on-prem IP address list` of a subnet includes both the list of IP addresses of VMs that will be
migrated and the list of IP addresses of VMs that will remain on-prem 
but need to communicate with the migrated VMs. 

One simple way to specifiy this address range is to provide the list of IP addresses of 
all running VMs, excluding CloudN IP address, since out of this list, 
some or all VMs will be migrated to cloud. For example, as shown in the above diagram, 
if the running VMs excluding CloudN on subnet 172.16.1.0/24 are in the range of 172.16.1.10-172.16.1.20, 
and you plan to move all running VMs to cloud, then specify this range for Step 1 as below.  

    ::

      172.16.1.10-172.16.1.20

.. Note:: the on-prem IP address format must have a "-" in the list even when it is a single IP address. Spcifiy multiple list by separting them with a comma. 

..

Note the larger this list is, the larger IPmotion gateway instance size needs to be in the cloud (AWS). 
The reason is that IPmotion gateway needs to allocate private IP addresses from AWS
for any on-prem VMs. 

You can optimize the list by making sure only the running VMs are being specified. For the above example, if 172.16.1.11 is an IP address not assigned to any VM, you should skip this address and specify a multiple range separating by a comma: 172.16.1.10-172.16.1.10,172.16.1.12-172.16.1.20. 

    ::
     
      172.16.1.10-172.16.1.10,172.16.1.12-172.16.1.20


Currently the largest number of VMs that a CloudN can handle on a subnet is 231 which requires a c4.4xlarge IPmotion gateway instance size. This number of VMs can be expanded in the future release. 

(You can further optimize the list for the on-prem part by specifying only the 
dependent VMs. 
For example, the CloudN is deployed on subnet 172.16.1.0/24. On this subnet, IP addresses of VMs that are planed to be migrated are 
172.16.1.10, 172.16.1.15-172.16.1.20. 
IP addresses of VMs that are to remain on the subnet but need to 
communicate with migrated VMs are in the range 172.16.1.50-172.16.1.70
then you should enter 
172.16.1.10-172.16.1.10,172.16.1.15-172.16.1.20,172.16.1.50-172.16.1.70)

  ::

   172.16.1.10-172.16.1.10,172.16.1.15-172.16.1.20,172.16.1.50-172.16.1.70


2. Reserve IPmotion Gateway IP Address List
--------------------------------------------

This field is about specifying 10 IP addresses that are not being used by 
any running VMs and reserve these addresses for Aviatrix IPmotion gateway. Again as an example displayed in 
the above diagram, 172.16.1.100-172.16.1.110 are not used by any running VMs, you can reserve this range
for IPmotion gateway. In another words, 
if you specify 172.16.1.100-172.16.1.110 as IPmotion gateway reserved IP addresses, 
it means that these range of IP addresses are not currently used by any VM on 
the subnet, they are reserved by Aviatrix during migration phase. 

.. Note:: AWS reserves the 5 IP addresses of a subnet in VPC. For example, if the VPC subnet is 172.16.1.0/24, the addresses 172.16.1.0, 172.16.1.1, 172.16.1.2, 172.16.1.3 and 172.16.1.255 are reserved by AWS.  if you have on-prem VMs including CloudN that uses the first 3 IP addresses (excluding default gateway, DNS or any other infrastructure purpose) of a subnet, the IPmotion method will not work. 

..


3. Launch IPmotion Gateway
----------------------------

This step launches an Aviatrix IPmotion gateway and builds an encrypted IPSEC tunnel between the two subnets. 
Note the IPmotion gateway size reflects how many on-prem VMs can be supported, as 
the table shown below.

===============================    ================================================================================
**IPmotion Gateway Size**           **Max VMs can be migrated**
===============================    ================================================================================
t2.micro                           1
t2.small                           5
t2.medium                          14
m4.large                           17
m4.xlarge                          55
m4.2xlarge                         55
m4.16xlarge                        231
c3.large                           26
c3.xlarge                          55
c3.2xlarge                         55
c3.4xlarge                         231
c4.large                           26
c4.xlarge                          55
c4.2xlarge                         55
c4.4xlarge                         231
c4.8xlarge                         231

4. IPmotion Move
------------------

This step consists of two parts: Staging and Commit. 

Staging
^^^^^^^^
Staging is the preparation step. After an IP address is moved to Staging state, 
you can power up the migrated EC2 instance with the same IP address as the on-prem VM  
for testing and staging. Note the migrated EC2 instance at this point cannot communicate with on prem.

Highlight a specific IP address in on-prem panel and click the Staging button. 

Undo Staging
^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to move any IP address in Staging state back to on-prem, select the IP address and click Undo. 

.. Note:: if the migrated EC2 instance is already running, you must terminate the instance from AWS console before you can move its IP address back to on-prem state. 

..


Commit
^^^^^^^^
Commit is to enable the migrated EC2 instance to communicate with any on-Prem VM. 

.. Note:: Before you commit an IP address, the on-prem VM that has been migrated must be powered down first. Commit the IP address implies that the migrated EC2 instance will be in operation. 
..

Hightlight a specific IP address and click the Commit button. 

Undo Commit
^^^^^^^^^^^

If migration fail after cut over, you can Undo the Commit by 
selecting the IP address from the cloud panel and click Undo.  

Undo function of Commit is to revert a committed IP address to Staging state. After reverting to Staging state, 
the communication between the migrated EC2 instance to on-prem is stopped and you can power up the on-prem VM and resume its operation. 


5. Test Connectivity
---------------------

After an IP address is committed, you can test connectivity. 
Go to CloudN console, Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> Network -> Ping Utility. Enter the committed IP address
and click Ping. Make sure the security group of the migrated EC2 has ICMP allowed. Also make sure the 
migrated EC2 instance responds to Ping request.  

6. Troubleshooting Tips
-----------------------

- **View Button** click View button on Step 1 or Step 2 at any time to see what state an IP address is at.  
- **Reset Button** If all things fail and you like to start over, first delete the IPmotion gateway by going to Gateway List, select the gateway and click Delete. After Delete is completed, go to Step 1 and click Reset. You can then start it over by going through Step 1 again.  
- **Get Support** email support@aviatrix.com for assistance. 

7. Migrate more VMs on the same subnet
---------------------------------------

Repeat Step 4 to migrate more VMs on this subnet.

8. Migrate VMs in a different subnet
-------------------------------------

To migrate a VM in a different subnet, you need to launch a new virtual appliance CloudN on that subnet 
and repeat all the steps described in this document. 

For example, suppose you have created a VPC 10.16.0.0/16 and migrated subnet 10.1.0.0/24. Now you plan to migrate subnet 10.1.1.0/24. Follow these steps:

- Go to AWS console to create a second public subnet 10.1.1.0/24 in VPC 10.16.0.0/16. 
- Launch Aviatrix virtual appliance CloudN on subnet 10.1.1.0/24.
- Repeat the steps listed in this document.  

9. Post Migration
------------------

Once you have migrated a few subnets to a VPC, you have the option to delete Aviatrix IPmotion gateway, delete the Aviatrix on-prem virtual appliance 
and remove the on-prem subnets that are now empty of any VMs. 
You can then connect the VPC to on-prem via Aviatrix site2cloud, 
AWS Direct Connect and other layer 3 connectivities. 

10. Limitations
----------------

There are a few known limitations in the current release. 

  - Cannot migrate any on-prem VMs whose IP addresses overlap with AWS reserved IP addresses on a given subnet. AWS reserves five IP addresses of a given subnet, if an on-prem VM overlaps with any of these three IP address, this solution cannot migrate this VM. 

  - VPC CIDR cannot be 192.168.0.0/16. In the 192.168.0.0 range, the largest CIDR is 192.168.0.0/17. 

  - The maximum number of on-prem VMs can be migrated per subnet is 231.

  - Aviatrix IPmotion solution is deployed on a per subnet bases, the maximum throughput per gateway is 1Gbps for IPSec performance.
