Anonymous Internet Surfing
========================================================



1. Solution Overview
======================

Normally when you surf an Internet website, the website administrator can easily identify where the user is located. This is done by identifying the source IP address (public IP address assigned to your location) contained in the packets.  Sometimes, business needs arise when your employee's internet browsing and online research needs to be anonymous or needs to appear to originate from some other place. For example, when analysis of competitors is required or when avoiding countries' firewalls for better performance and access.
This document describes how to set up anonymous browsing from a client machine by routing internet traffic through an AWS-based gateway in a different region.

2. Configuration Workflow
==========================

2.1 Pre Configuration checklist
-------------------------------

Before configuring VPC Site to Cloud peering, make sure the following prerequisites are completed.

**Pre Configuration Check List**

1.  Deploy the Aviatrix Controller

2.  Create AWS VPCs and Check Settings

These prerequisites are explained in detail below.

2.1.1  Deploy the Aviatrix Controller
-------------------------------------

The Aviatrix Controller must be deployed and setup prior to configuring
VPC and site peering. Please refer to "Aviatrix Controller Getting
Started Guide for AWS" on how to deploy the Aviatrix Controller.

`Aviatrix Controller Getting Started
Guide <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-download/docs/aviatrix_aws_controller_gsg.pdf>`_

Check and make sure you can access the Aviatrix Controller dashboard and
login with an administrator account. The default URL for the Aviatrix
Controller is:

https://<public ip of Aviatrix Controller>

2.1.2  Create AWS VPCs and Check Settings
-----------------------------------------

-   Create 2 VPCs - VPC #1 (in Region 1) with CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 and VPC #2 (in Region 2) with CIDR 10.2.0.0/16

-   In VPC #1, create 2 public subnets in the same Availability Zone - 10.1.0.0/24 and 10.1.1.0/24.
    This means that both subnets must be associated with a route table whose default route points to IGW.

-   In VPC #2, create 1 public subnet - 10.2.0.0/24.
    This means that one subnet must be associated with a route table whose default route points to IGW.

2.2 Configuration Steps
-----------------------

Make sure the pre-configuration steps in the previous section are completed before proceeding.

The instructions in this section will use the following architecture.
The CIDR and subnets may vary depending on your VPC setup; however, the
general principles will be the same.
