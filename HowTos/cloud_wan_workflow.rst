Aviatrix CloudWAN Workflow
============================================================

To learn CloudWAN, check out `CloudWAN FAQ. <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/cloud_wan_faq.html>`_

Register a Branch Router
---------------------------------------

Register a branch router to the Controller so the Controller can access its configuration, make changes to it and 
monitor its health and statistics. 

Connect to the Controller
--------------------------------------------------

After a branch router is registered, the controller connects to its publicly accessible interface of the branch router to retrieve its configuration. 

Prepare to Attach
---------------------

This step retrieves the IOS router configuration and let user select the WAN interfaces. 

In the drop down menu, select the branch device. Click Upload Config. After the configuration is uploaded, the drop down menu should the list of interfaces. Select one and click Save. 


Attach Branch to Cloud
-----------------------------------------

This step has 3 options. 
It creates an IPSEC tunnel between the IOS router and the Aviatrix Transit Gateway, between the IOS router and TGW VPN or IOS router and Azure vWAN. 

Option 1: Attach to an Aviatrix Transit Gateway

List/Edit
------------

This pages allows you to do manual edit of an registered or connected IOS router. 

Highlight a branch device, click Edit. Two panels should come up. On the left side is the latest IOS 
router configuration. Click Show Previous Commit Diff highlights the diffs in configuration. 

On the right side of the panel, you can enter IOS commands to make changes. For example, to change the router name, 
enter the following commands and click Commit. 

::

  hostname myrouter

Save & Restore Config
---------------------------

For each branch router under management, multiple copies of IOS configuration can be saved on the Aviatrix Controller. 
Go to CloudWAN -> List/Edit page, select one branch router under management, click the 3 dots skewer, select Save Config. 
Enter name Configuration Name and optional description. 

Saved Configurations can be applied to a branch router via "Restore A Configuration". 
Go to CloudWAN -> List/Edit page, select one branch router, click the 3 dots skewer, select Save Config. 
On the "RESTORE A CONFIGURATION", select a saved configuration and click Restore, the action will trigger a commit of 
saved IOS configuration to the router. Click Show Config to view the saved configuration. 


AWS Network Manager Integration
-----------------------------------

Aviatrix CloudWAN can be integrated with AWS Network Manager for visualization. Follow the steps below to:

 - Create a Global Network
 - Register AWS Transit Gateway
 - Register Branch Device

Configuration Tags
----------------------

Aviatrix CloudWAN automatically programs CLIs required to connect to Aviatrix Transit Gateway or TGW VPN. 
There are times when you need to add additional CLIs to the routers. Configuration Tags provide a way to 
manage these additional CLIs in a scalable way. 

A tag contains a block of CLI commands. 
A tag can be attached to one or more branch routers. When Commit a tag, CLIs commands in the
tag is committed to the routers attached to the tag. 

Create a Tag
--------------

Provide a unique name to a new tag. For example, name the tag tier1-branches.

Edit a Tag
------------

For a given tag, enter CLI commands exactly the way it should be programmed. 

Attach to Branch Routers
-------------------------

Select branch routers to be part of Include or Exclude list to a given tag. 

Commit Tag to Branch Router
-----------------------------

Select a tag, click Commit. The CLIs in the tag are committed to the branch routers attached to the tag.
