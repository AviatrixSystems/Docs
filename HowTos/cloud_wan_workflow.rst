Aviatrix CloudWAN Workflow
============================================================

To learn CloudWAN, check out `CloudWAN FAQ. <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/cloud_wan_faq.html>`_

Register a Branch Router
---------------------------------------

Register a branch router to the Controller so the Controller can access its configuration, make changes to it and 
monitor its health and statistics. 

Connect to the Controller
--------------------------------------------------

After a branch router is registered, the controller connects to its publicly accessible interface to retrieve its configuration. 

Prepare to Attach
---------------------

This step retrieves the IOS router configuration and let user select the WAN interfaces. 

In the drop down menu, select the branch device. Click Upload Config. After the configuration is uploaded, the drop down menu should the list of interfaces. Select one and click Save. 


Attach Branch to Cloud
-----------------------------------------

This step creates an IPSEC tunnel between the IOS router and the Aviatrix Transit Gateway or between the IOS router and TGW VPN. . 

Attach to an Aviatrix Transit Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you connect the branch router to an Aviatrix Transit Gateway, refer to the following fields to attach the branch router. 

=========================================              ==========================
Input Field                                            Value

List/Edit
------------

This pages allows you to do manual edit of an registered or connected IOS router. 

Highlight a branch device, click Edit. Two panels should come up. On the left side is the latest IOS 
router configuration. Click Show Previous Commit Diff highlights the diffs in configuration. 

On the right side of the panel, you can enter IOS commands to make changes. For example, to change the router name, 
enter the following commands and click Commit. 

::

  hostname myrouter


AWS Network Manager Integration
-----------------------------------

Aviatrix CloudWAN can be integrated with AWS Network Manager for visualization. Follow the steps below to:

 - Create a Global Network
 - Register AWS Transit Gateway
 - Register Branch Device
