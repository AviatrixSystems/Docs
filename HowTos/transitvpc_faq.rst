Transit Network FAQ
============================

Why should I choose Transit architecture?
-------------------------------------------

Transit architecture is about building connectivity between cloud and on-prem in 
the most agile manner possible. In the transit architecture, there is one 
connection (not counting backup here) between on-prem and 
and a transit VPC, everything else (the Spoke VPCs to on-prem traffic) is routed through the transit VPC.  

The alternative (call it flat architecture) to transit architecture is to build one connection, either IPSEC over Internet or Direct Connect, 
each time when you spin up a new VPC or VNet in the cloud. This requires change at the on-prem edge which
requires a change control process that takes from days to weeks. 


How does Aviatrix Transit Network Solution differ from Cisco CSR based solution?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They differ in the following areas.

 - **Network Segmentation** In the CSR solution, all Spoke VPCs have connectivity to each other through the Transit GW, even though these Spoke VPCs belong to different AWS account or business teams. In contrast, the Spoke VPCs have no connectivity to each other by default. Connectivity is built by design.

 - **Connectivity Efficiency** In Aviatrix solution, traffic between any two Spoke VPCs are routed directly, instead of going through the Transit GW, as opposed to going through the Transit GW in the CSR case. Decoupling the different traffic steam reduces performance bottleneck and removes single failure point. 

 - **Central Control** In Aviatrix solution, the Aviatrix Controller is the single pane of glass for all networking in the cloud. 

 - **Simplicity** In Aviatrix solution, BGP is only deployed between Transit GW and VGW. No Spoke VPCs run BGP protocol. Simplicity leads to stability. Workflow based step by step instructions help you build out a Transit VPC solution in minutes. 

For a fun read, here is a `blog on the differences. <https://www.aviatrix.com/blog/aviatrix-global-transit-solution-differ-csr-solution/>`_

How does Aviatrix Transit Network work?
----------------------------------------

In the transit VPC, the Aviatrix gateway establishes two BGP sessions (for redundancy) to AWS VGW. 
Routes from on-prem network is propagated to the Aviatrix gateway which forward them to the Aviatrix Controller. 
The Controller detects route changes and program the Spoke VPCs for updated routes. 

In the direction from Spoke VPC to on-prem network, when a Spoke VPC is attached to the Transit Group, 
the Controller notifies the Aviatrix gateway in the transit VPC to advertise the new Spoke VPC CIDR to VGW.

Since all Spoke VPC routes are managed by the Aviatrix Controller, a Spoke VPC CIDR is not advertised to any
other Spoke VPCs, therefore there is no connectivity between them through the transit VPC gateway. 

A Shared Service VPC is essentially one special Spoke VPC. The Shared Service VPC typically host 
common DevOps tools that needs connectivity to other Spoke VPCs. You can accomplish this connectivity by 
setting up either native AWS Peering or Aviatrix Encrypted Peering from the Aviatrix Controller. 

How do I configure a Global Transit Network with Aviatrix solution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the `Aviatrix Transit Network Workflow <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html>`_. 

Should I deploy one Transit Group for Dev and one for Prod?
------------------------------------------------------------

If your reason for two Transit hubs is security and smaller blast radius, you need not to when using Aviatrix solution. By design, none of Spoke VPCs can talk to each other. Check out the `Single region design. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#single-region-transit-vpc-design>`_  

I have two regions and two Direct Connects, how do I build a multi region Transit solution?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For multi region, the redundancy is best built over VGW. Check out our `multi region design <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#multi-regions-transit-vpc-design>`_

I have more than 100 VPCs, how do I overcome AWS route limits?
----------------------------------------------------------------

When you deploy Aviatrix Transit VPC solution, all Aviatrix gateways, Transit and Spoke, are deployed with `Designated Gateway Feature <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#designated-gateway>_ enabled by default. This allows to manage as many Spoke VPCs as you need.

I have a few high bandwidth applications, how do I deploy them in a Transit solution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the Transit solution has a maximum IPSEC throughput of around 1.5Gbps from the Transit GW. To support applications that require higher bandwidth, check out `this design pattern. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#gbps-trnasit-vpc-design>`_

How can I fit a egress firewall into this Transit VPC solution?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Egress firewall is deployed to provide protection for Internet access by 
instances in the private subnets. It should not be deployed in the Transit GW VPC. Instead, route Internet bound traffic directly to the firewall appliance from the Spoke VPCs, as shown in the `Egress Control Design. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#integrating-with-egress-firewall>`_ 


Can Aviatrix Transit VPC be deployed with Terraform template?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, both APIs and Terraform are available for integration. 

For Terraform, check out `this link. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/Solutions/Setup_Transit_VPC_Solution_Terraform.html>`_

Does Aviatrix Transit Network support HA?
------------------------------------------

You can enable multi AZ HA during the workflow when launch a Transit VPC gateway or Spoke VPC gateway. 

Why is AWS t2 series instance types not recommended for production deployment on Transit GW?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a t2 series Transit GW communicate with VGW over IPSEC, there is a 3% packet drop for packet size less than 150 bytes by Transit GW due to an issue with AWS Xen hypervisor and the kernel version GW is using. This will be fixed in the future release. 

Note this packet drop issue does not affect Spoke gateways. 

How do I resize Transit GW instance?
-----------------------------------

Go to Gateway page at the navigation bar, select the Transit GW, click Edit, 
scroll up to see the options and find Gateway Resize. Select the desired size and click Change. 

Resizing Transit GW requires the gateway instance to be stopped and start again in 
a different size. There will be network time for traffic between cloud and on-prem.
There should be no downtime for traffic between VPCs as cloud to cloud traffic does 
not go through the Transit GW.  

During resizing, traffic will be switched to backup Transit GW if HA is enabled, 
this will also switch Spoke to Transit traffic if Spoke VPC has HA enabled. 
Resizing Transit GW will cause network downtime. 

How do I know which Transit GW a Spoke GW is sending traffic to?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can tell which Transit GW carries the network traffic from a specific 
Spoke VPC by going to Advanced Config -> BGP. Select the Transit GW and click 
Detail. If the list of the Advertised Network includes the Spoke VPC CIDR, this
Transit GW routes traffic from the Spoke to on-prem; if it does not, check out the 
backup Transit GW. 

How can I route VPC egress Internet bound traffic to on-prem to go through the corporate firewall?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you advertise 0.0.0.0/0 to VGW, Spoke VPCs will have that route points to Transit GW
and rouet egress Internet traffic to VGW and back to on-prem. Make sure you do not 
have NAT enabled on the Spoke GW or AWS NAT service enabled in the VPC.

How do I know if the tunnel between VGW and Transit GW is up?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Go to Site2Cloud, the tunnel status is displayed for each connection. 

How do I find out what routes being propagated from on-prem?
------------------------------------------------------------

On-prem routes are propagated to VGW which in turn propagated to the Transit GW. 
There are two ways to see what learned routes are by Transit GW: 

1. Go to Site2Cloud, select the connection you specified at Step 3 during Transit Network Workflow. Scroll down, you will see the Learned Network. Search for a learned routes by typing a specific CIDR. 
#. Go to Peering -> Transitive Peering. Click the box next to Destination CIDR column for a specific Spoke VPC GW. The Learned Routes will be shown and is searchable. 
#. Go to Advanced Config -> BGP -> select a Transit GW, click Detail

How do I find out BGP information on Transit GW?
-------------------------------------------------

Go to Advanced Config -> BGP -> Diagnostics, click the box for Predefined Show List. 
A list of BGP commands will be displayed. If you turn on debug command, make sure to 
turn it off when debug is finished to ensure the Transit GW is not flooded with debug
messaged. Excessive debug messages reduces throughput.

How do I delete a Spoke GW?
-----------------------------

Go to Gateway page, select the gateway you wish to delete and click Delete. 

An instance in a Spoke VPC cannot communicate with on-prem network, how do I troubleshoot?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many reasons why an instance cannot communicate with on-prem network. 
The following troubleshooting steps may be helpful. 

1. Make sure the `connection between VGW and Transit GW <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_faq.html#how-do-i-know-if-the-tunnel-between-vgw-and-transit-gw-is-up>`_ is up. 

#. Make sure the Spoke VPC where instance is deployed has `connectivity <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_faq.html#how-do-i-find-out-what-routes-being-propagated-from-on-prem>`_ to the problem subnet in on-prem network. 

#. Make sure the Spoke GW can reach the on-prem subnet. You can do a packet capture by going to Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> PACKET CAPTURE. Select the right tunnel interface and capture packets.  

#. If the above tests pass, you should security group settings on the instance and the destination VM.
