Transit Network FAQ
============================

Why should I choose Transit architecture?
-------------------------------------------

Transit architecture is about building connectivity between cloud and on-prem in the most agile manner possible. In the Transit architecture, there is one connection (not including the backup) between on-prem and a Transit VPC. Everything else (the Spoke VPCs to on-prem traffic) is routed through the Transit VPC.  

The alternative to Transit architecture (often referred to as "flat" architecture) is to build one connection, either IPSEC over Internet or Direct Connect, each time you spin up a new VPC or VNet in the cloud. This requires changes at the on-prem edge, which requires a change control process that takes from days to weeks. 

How does the Aviatrix Transit Network solution differ from Cisco's CSR-based solution?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They differ in the following areas:

 - **Network Segmentation** - In the CSR-based solution, all Spoke VPCs have connectivity to each other through the Transit GW, even though these Spoke VPCs belong to different AWS accounts or business teams. In contrast, the Spoke VPCs have no connectivity to each other, by default. Connectivity is built by design.

 - **Connectivity Efficiency** - In the Aviatrix solution, traffic between any two Spoke VPCs are routed directly, as opposed to going through the Transit GW as required by the CSR-based solution. Decoupling the different traffic streams reduces performance bottlenecks and removes single failure points. 

 - **Half Egress Charge** - In the Aviatrix solution, VPC to VPC traffic does not go through the Transit GW, resucing the AWS network egress charge by half.  

 - **No unwanted route propagation** - Since Spoke VPCs run BGP in CSR solution, if a Spoke VPC also connects to a partner network via VGW, the partner network routes could propagated to your own on-prem network.

 - **Central Control** - With the Aviatrix solution, the Aviatrix Controller is the single pane of glass for all networking in the cloud.

 - **Simplicity** - In Aviatrix's solution, BGP is only deployed between Transit GW and VGW. No Spoke VPCs run the BGP protocol. Simplicity leads to stability. Workflow-based, step-by-step instructions help you build out a Transit VPC solution in minutes. 

 - **Monitoring** - The Aviatrix solution integrates with Splunk, Sumo, remote syslog, ELK and DataDog to forward events from gateways to your favorite central logging service. 

 - **Scalable** - AWS has various limits in its infrastructure, such as a route entry limit of 100. This limits how many on-prem CIDRs and VPC CIDRs can be carried on a Transit GW. The Aviatrix solution overcomes that limitation. 

For a fun read, here is a `blog on the differences <https://www.aviatrix.com/blog/aviatrix-global-transit-solution-differ-csr-solution/>`_

How does the Aviatrix Transit Network work?
----------------------------------------

In the Transit VPC, the Aviatrix gateway establishes two BGP sessions (for redundancy) to AWS VGW. Routes from the on-prem network are propagated to the Aviatrix gateway, which forwards them to the Aviatrix Controller. The Controller detects route changes and programs the Spoke VPCs for updated routes. 

In the direction from the Spoke VPC to the on-prem network, when a Spoke VPC is attached to the Transit Group, the Controller notifies the Aviatrix gateway in the Transit VPC to advertise the new Spoke VPC CIDR to VGW.

Since all Spoke VPC routes are managed by the Aviatrix Controller, a Spoke VPC CIDR is not advertised to any other Spoke VPCs. Therefore, there is no connectivity between them through the Transit VPC gateway. 

A Shared Service VPC is essentially one special Spoke VPC. The Shared Service VPC typically hosts common DevOps tools that need connectivity to other Spoke VPCs. You can accomplish this connectivity by setting up either native AWS Peering or Aviatrix Encrypted Peering from the Aviatrix Controller. 

Where can I find the Aviatrix Global Transit Network solution?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Aviatrix Controller is available in the `AWS Marketplace. <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=aviatrix&page=1&ref_=nav_search_box>`_

How do I configure a Global Transit Network with the Aviatrix solution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the `Aviatrix Transit Network Workflow <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html>`_. 

Should I deploy one Transit Group for Dev and one for Prod?
------------------------------------------------------------

If your reason for two Transit hubs is security and a smaller blast radius, this is not required when using Aviatrix's solution. By design, none of the Spoke VPCs can talk to each other. Check out the `single region design. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#single-region-transit-vpc-design>`_  

I have two regions and two Direct Connects. How do I build a multi region Transit solution?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For multi region, the redundancy is best built over VGW. Check out our `multi region design. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#multi-regions-transit-vpc-design>`_

I have more than 100 VPCs. How do I overcome AWS route limits?
----------------------------------------------------------------

When you deploy Aviatrix Transit VPC solution, all Aviatrix gateways, Transit and Spoke, are deployed with `Designated Gateway Feature <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#designated-gateway>`_ enabled by default. This allows you to manage as many Spoke VPCs as you need.

Can I launch multiple Transit GW groups from one Controller?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can launch multiple Transit GW groups from one Aviatrix Controller. Go to the Transit Network workflow and start 
from `Step 1 <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html#launch-a-transit-gateway>`_ to launch a new Transit GW group. 

I have a few high bandwidth applications. How do I deploy them in a Transit solution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Transit solution has a maximum IPSEC throughput of around 1.5Gbps from the Transit GW. To support applications that require higher bandwidth, check out `this design pattern. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#gbps-trnasit-vpc-design>`_

How can I fit an egress firewall into this Transit VPC solution?
---------------------------------------------------------------

An egress firewall is deployed to provide protection for Internet access by instances in the private subnets. It should not be deployed in the Transit GW VPC. Instead, route Internet-bound traffic directly to the firewall appliance from the Spoke VPCs, as shown in `Egress Control Design. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_designs.html#integrating-with-egress-firewall>`_ 

Can the Aviatrix Transit VPC be deployed with a Terraform template?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, both APIs and Terraform are available for integration. 

For Terraform, check out `this link. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Setup_Transit_Network_Terraform.html#setup-transit-network-using-aviatrix-terraform-provider>`_

What are the automation methods for the Transit Network?
-----------------------------------------------------

There are multiple resources to help you automate Transit Network setup. If you are building a Transit Network following the workflow, you should use the APIs documented below.

 - `Transit Network section in API doc <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Aviatrix_Controller_API.html>`_

 - `Terraform example <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Setup_Transit_Network_Terraform.html>`_

 - `Python API example for Transit Network <https://github.com/AviatrixSystems/TransitNetworkAPI_python_example>`_

Does the Aviatrix Transit Network support HA?
------------------------------------------

You can enable multi AZ HA during the workflow when launching a Transit VPC gateway or Spoke VPC gateway. 

Why are AWS t2 series instance types not recommended for production deployment on Transit GW?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a t2 series Transit GW communicates with VGW over IPSEC, there is a 3% packet drop for packet sizes less than 150 bytes by Transit GW due to an issue with the AWS Xen hypervisor and the kernel version GW is using. This will be fixed in the future release. 

Note that this packet drop issue does not affect Spoke gateways. 

How do I resize a Transit GW instance?
------------------------------------

Go to the Gateway page in the navigation bar, select the Transit GW, click Edit, then scroll up to see the options and find Gateway Resize. Select the desired size and click Change. 

Resizing a Transit GW requires the gateway instance to be stopped and started again in a different size. There will be network time for traffic between cloud and on-prem. There should be no downtime for traffic between VPCs as cloud-to-cloud traffic does 
not go through the Transit GW.  

During resizing, traffic will be switched to backup Transit GW if HA is enabled. This will also switch Spoke to Transit traffic if the Spoke VPC has HA enabled. Resizing Transit GW will cause network downtime. 

How do I know which Transit GW a Spoke GW is sending traffic to?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can tell which Transit GW carries the network traffic from a specific Spoke VPC by going to Advanced Config -> BGP. Select the Transit GW and click Detail. If the list of the Advertised Network includes the Spoke VPC CIDR, this Transit GW routes traffic from the Spoke to on-prem; if it does not, check out the backup Transit GW. 

How can I route VPC egress Internet-bound traffic to on-prem to go through the corporate firewall?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you advertise 0.0.0.0/0 to VGW, Spoke VPCs will have that route pointing to Transit GW and route egress Internet traffic to VGW and back to on-prem. Make sure you do not have NAT enabled on the Spoke GW, or AWS NAT service enabled in the VPC.

How do I know if the tunnel between VGW and Transit GW is up?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Go to Site2Cloud. The tunnel status is displayed for each connection. 

How do I find out what routes are being propagated from on-prem?
------------------------------------------------------------

On-prem routes are propagated to VGW, which in turn are propagated to the Transit GW. There are two ways to see what learned routes are by Transit GW: 

1. Go to Site2Cloud and select the connection you specified at Step 3 during the Transit Network Workflow. Scroll down and you will see the Learned Network. Search for learned routes by typing a specific CIDR. 
#. Go to Peering -> Transitive Peering. Click the box next to the Destination CIDR column for a specific Spoke VPC GW. The Learned Routes will be shown, and are searchable. 
#. Go to Advanced Config -> BGP -> select a Transit GW, and click Detail

How do I find out BGP information on a Transit GW?
-------------------------------------------------

Go to Advanced Config -> BGP -> Diagnostics, and click the box for Predefined Show List. A list of BGP commands will be displayed. If you turn on the debug command, make sure to turn it off when debug is finished to ensure the Transit GW is not flooded with debug messages. Excessive debug messages reduce throughput.

How do I delete a Spoke GW?
-----------------------------

Go to the Gateway page, select the gateway you wish to delete and click Delete. 

An instance in a Spoke VPC cannot communicate with the on-prem network. How do I troubleshoot?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many reasons why an instance in a Spoke VPC cannot communicate with the on-prem host or VM. The troubleshooting steps below be helpful. 

1. Make sure the `connection between VGW and Transit GW <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_faq.html#how-do-i-know-if-the-tunnel-between-vgw-and-transit-gw-is-up>`_ is up. 

#. Make sure the CIDR of the on-prem problem subnet (where the VM or host is not reachable from a Spoke VPC instance) is propagated to Spoke VPC. That is, make sure the Spoke VPC where the problem instance is deployed has `connectivity <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_faq.html#how-do-i-find-out-what-routes-being-propagated-from-on-prem>`_ to the problem subnet in the on-prem network. 

#. Run a traceroute by using an Aviatrix gateway as a test EC2. Launch t2.micro instance of Aviatrix Gateway from the `Gateway <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#gateway>`_ in the navigation bar. This gateway will be used as a test EC2 instance. Once this gateway is launched, you can run a `traceroute <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/troubleshooting.html#network-traceroute>`_ from this gateway (the test EC2 instance) to the on-prem problem VM. When the test is complete, remember to delete the gateway to conserve consumption.

#. Do a traceroute from the on-prem problem VM or host to the Aviatrix gateway test EC2 launched in the steps above. 

#. You can do a packet capture by going to Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> PACKET CAPTURE. Select the right tunnel interface and run packet capture.  

#. If the above tests pass, you should check the security group settings on the instance and the destination VM. 

How do I build encryption over Direct Connect?
------------------------------------------------

AWS provides a native solution to add VPN capability between VGW and on-prem over Direct Connect. This improves security as data in motion is encrypted. Follow `the instructions here <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-vpn-direct-connect/>`_ for this capability. 

We build encryption between the Aviatrix Transit GW and VGW, and between the Transit GW and Spoke GW to provide end-to-end encryption protection. 

How do I build redundancy between VGW and on-prem?
--------------------------------------------------

AWS provides a few native options for redundancy between VGW and on-prem. You can build redundant active/active VPN connections, redundant active/active DX connections and DX with backup VPN connections.

`Read this doc <https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-multiple-data-center-ha-network-connectivity/>`_ for implementation details. 

How do I deploy user VPN use case on Transit Network solution?
--------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend you to deploy `user VPN <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/uservpn.html>`_ in a 
shared service VPC. If this shared servicec VPC has connectivity to all other VPCs, a user can reach any instances in these VPCs as long as his/her profile policy allows.
