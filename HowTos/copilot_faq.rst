Aviatrix CoPilot FAQs
============================================================


What is the default login for copilot? 
====================================================

Today copilot authenticates against aviatrix controller’s list of local users.  

Are the traffic flow records coming from controller or gateways?  
===============================================================================

While it is configured in the controller, but the actual flows come from the gateways directly to CoPilot's instance.

What protocol does CoPilot use to talk to its controller? 
===============================================================================

RestAPI and HTTPS 

How long does it take for data to start showing in FlowIQ? 
===============================================================================


It may take ~5 Minutes for flow data to appear in the UI 

How are updates handled? Can I configure it?
===============================================================================

Automatic update process runs every 60 Mins, and automatically applies. In order to stop updates, you can stop updates service under the services tab

Can the instance be smaller than market place recommendation?  
===============================================================================

Not recommended for production to size down. For small scale testing or POC purposes , you can chose smaller instance size. To avoid issues, you will need to ensure that your memory configruation in the app is adjusted down as well.  

Can I configure flows to be sent over private IPs? 
===============================================================================

Copilot does not setup a private overlay between gateways and itself. If a private communication path between the gateways and Copilot is available, then you can use Copilot’s private IP when you input the collector IP in the controller. 
For example, if you have Aviatrix transit everywhere, and you put Copilot in one of the spokes, then you can private IP as the destination. 



Does Copilot hold any user or sensitive data?  
===============================================================================

Copilot does not hold any user-identifiable or payment processing information. As of this release, it also does not hold any credentials on the appliance’s storage. However, it is a recommended to ensure all security best practices are followed. 

Can I Encrypt Volumes for CoPilot 
===============================================================================

In AWS, you can use EBS encryption should this be a requirement. To encrypt the disk for CoPilot, you will need to ensure encryption option is checked during launch of the VM. 
If this is not done at time of launch, you will then have to create a snapshot and recreate a new instance from that snapshot 

How does CoPilot get its data?
===============================================================================

1.Controller APIs

  CoPilot dials into controller to retrieve information from CoPilot

2.Flow records

  Aviatrix Gateways generate and export information about network traffic. Flows come directly from  Gateways to CoPilot


Is FlowIQ showing realtime traffic? 
===============================================================================

Flow records are generated by the Gateways. The ageent on the Gateways observes and keeps track of the flows and as soon as a particular flow ends, or if the flow expiry interval is reached, the flow record is sent to CoPilot.

How long is the data retained ? 
===============================================================================

This will depend on the nature of traffic and volume. The answer to this question will vary depending on different environment.

Can the data retention be adjusted ? 
===============================================================================

Today you can set a threshhold based on disk space available, so that you can remove the old records

Can we turn topology tunnels Red/Green based on tunnel status ? 
===============================================================================
The tunnles are responsive to the state of the link.

Can we provide bandwidth details of links/tunnels 
===============================================================================
If you can specify source and destination for the two endpoint of the path, i.d gateways, you will be able to obtain this information from FlowIQ by using filters
