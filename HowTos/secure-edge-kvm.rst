Deploying Aviatrix Edge  2.0 (Edge as a Spoke)
=================================

This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Aviatrix Edge 2.0 on either VMware ESXi or an open-source Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). 

Aviatrix Edge 2.0 enables you to extend your cloud network to the Edge and easily integrate it with your remote locations and data centers. You can extend your Aviatrix-managed platform to the Edge as well as support multi-cloud/multi-transit connectivity. For examples of Edge 2.0 designs, refer to Edge Design Patterns below. For additional information about Aviatrix Edge 2.0, refer to Aviatrix Edge FAQ. 

For the Aviatrix Edge 1.0 for ESXi workflow, refer to `Deploying Aviatrix Edge 1.0 for VMware ESXi <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Controller_and_Software_Release_Notes.html#preview-features>`_.


.. note::
   Aviatrix Edge 2.0 is currently supported in AWS, Azure, and OCI.    GCP is only supported for non-High-Performance Encryption (HPE) environments.
