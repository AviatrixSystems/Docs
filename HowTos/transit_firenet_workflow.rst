Transit FireNet  Workflow
=========================================================

For questions about Transit FireNet, check out `Transit FireNet FAQ. <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_firenet_faq.html>`_ 

Prerequisite
---------------

Transit FireNet builds on the Aviatrix Encrypted Transit Network. Follow the `Aviatrix Encrypted Transit Network workflow <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html>`_ to deploy Aviatrix Transit Gateways and Spoke gateways. ActiveMesh mode option must be selected when launching the gateways. 


1. Enable Transit FireNet Function
------------------------------------------------

.. important::

  for AWS deployment, Transit FireNet works when the Aviatrix Transit Gateway is launched with ActiveMesh enabled. 

  Transit FireNet works when the Transit Network is in Connected mode. Go to Transit Network -> Advanced Config -> Connected Transit. Click Enable. 

In the drop down menu, select one Aviatrix Transit Gateway and click Enable. 

2. Manage Transit FireNet Policy
--------------------------------------

Select an Aviatrix Transit Gateway that you enabled for FireNet function in the previous step. 

On the left side of the panel, highlight one Spoke VPC/VNet for inspection and click Add. The selected Spoke VPC/VNet should appear on the right side panel. 

For example, if traffic going in and out of VPC Spoke2 where Spoke2-gw is deployed should be inspected, move the Spoke2-gw to the right, as shown below. 

|transit_firenet_policy|
