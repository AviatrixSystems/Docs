Peering FAQ
===========================


What does Aviatrix encrypted peering do?
-----------------------------------------

Aviatrix encrypted peering builds an encrypted tunnel between two
VPC/VNet with a single click. In addition to building the encrypted connection,
the Controller also programs the cloud infrastructure routing table so that
you don't have to.

The VPC and/or VNet can be across regions
and across the cloud. The solution enables you to build an
encrypted network. You can enable stateful firewalls on each VPC/VNet to
add additional security measures.

When should I consider using Aviatrix encrypted peering?
---------------------------------------------------------

Check `this link. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/aviatrix_overview.html#cloud-to-cloud-peering>`_

How do I configure encrypted peering?
---------------------------------------


	Step 1: Gateway -> +New Gateway in one existing VPC/VNet. VPN
	access may be disabled.

	Step 2: Repeat Step 1 with a different VPC ID or VNet Name.

	Step 3: At Peering -> Encrypted Peering -> +New Peering. Select the two
	gateway names and click OK.

Is native AWS Peering supported?
--------------------------------

Yes, you can configure AWS intra region peering and inter region peering where it is available 
from the Controller console. Go to Peering -> AWS Peering.

Cross accounts are supported. 

How do I configure encrypted peering with ActiveMesh and Insane Mode both enabled?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can configure an encrypted peering with ActiveMesh and Insane Mode by going through the `Transit Network workflow <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html>`_, as described in the following steps. 

 1. Go to Transit Network -> Setup -> Step 4, Launch a Spoke Gateway to launch the primary Spoke Gateway. Select ActiveMesh. Select Insane Encryption.
 #. Go to Transit Network -> Setup -> Step 5, Enable HA to launch the HA gateway for the Spoke Gateway created in the above step.
 #. Repeat the above two steps for the peering VPC. 
 #. Go to Peering -> Encrypted Peering, +Add New. Select the two primary gateways created in the above steps. Select HA. Click OK. 

Note that both primary gateway and backup gateway forward traffic. The VPC route tables are divided so that half of the route tables 
point the peered VPC CIDR to the primary gateway and the other half of the route tables point the peered VPC CIDR to the HA gateway. This
division is best effort. 

Each gateway runs ECMP to the peered gateways.  

What is the encryption algorithm for encrypted peering? 
---------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1:
  - Authentication: SHA-256
  - DH group: 14
  - Encryption: AES-256-CBC

Phase 2:
   - Authentication: AES-128-GCM-96
   - Encryption: AES-128-GCM-96
