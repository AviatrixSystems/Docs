Scale out remote user VPN Solution
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No more bastion stations and jump hosts. Provide your employees with the
ability to seamlessly access instances with private IP addresses by
using our user VPN capability. To configure Cloud VPN:

1. At Gateway menu, create a gateway with VPN access enabled.

2. Repeat the above step for multiple gateways if ELB is
   enabled to create a scale out VPN solution.

3. (Optional) At OpenVPN® -> Profiles, define VPN user profiles and
   access policies for each profile that will be dynamically enforced as
   user connects to the cloud at the network perimeter.

4. At OpenVPN® -> VPN Users, add VPN users.
