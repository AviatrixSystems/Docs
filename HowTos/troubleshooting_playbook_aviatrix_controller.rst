Check whether the DNS function works properly in Aviatrix Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Check Point 1: Check Aviatrix function CONTROLLER PUBLIC IP from Aviatrix Controller GUI

      * https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Troubleshoot_Diagnostics.html#controller-public-ip

      * Steps:
      
        1. Navigate to the Aviatrix GUI page: Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> Network -> CONTROLLER PUBLIC IP

      * Expect to view only one public IP

      * If the output displays empty, Aviatrix solution will not work properly

    Probable Causes:

      * DNS which is used by Aviatrix Controller cannot resolve/forward a public domain name request properly.

    Suggestions:

      * Attempt to use a public DNS such as 8.8.8.8 or cloud platform default DNS first

      * `Check basic network configuration of AWS where Aviatrix Controller locates from AWS portal`_
