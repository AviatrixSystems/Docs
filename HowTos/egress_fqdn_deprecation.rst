Migrate Egress FQDN Filtering to Distributed Cloud Firewall
As of Controller 7.1.1710, `Distributed Cloud Firewall (DCF) <https://docs.aviatrix.com/documentation/latest/network-security/index.html>`_ with `WebGroups <https://docs.aviatrix.com/documentation/latest/network-security/egress-webgroups.html>`_, configured in CoPilot, is the recommended method for configuring and implementing Egress Security.
Aviatrix strongly recommends migrating from Egress FQDN Filtering (Legacy) to Distributed Cloud Firewall to enforce Egress network security policy.
