Migrating VMs with Aviatrix IPMotion and AWS Migration Hub Service
===================================================================



1. Solution Overview
======================

This document describes how to migrate an on-prem VM to AWS while preserving its IP address. The migration tools we use are
AWS Migration Hub service (AWS Server Migration Service) and Aviatrix IPmotion, where Aviatrix IPmotion feature enables IP address preservation after a VM is migrated to AWS via AWS Server Migration Service.

By preserving the IP address of an on-prem VM after migrating
to AWS, dependencies of this VM to other on-prems are automatically preserved, thus there is no need to discover the dependencies for migration purpose. There is no need to update on-prem security rules, AD, DNS and Load Balancers.



2. Configuration Workflow
==========================

The instructions in this section will use the following network diagram.
The CIDR and subnets may vary depending on your network setup; however, the
general principle will be the same.

2.1 Prerequisites
-------------------------------

Before setting up Aviatrix IPMotion for migration, make sure
the following prerequisites are completed.

1.  Plan the Cloud Address and create an AWS VPC

2.  Setup AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) to create migrated AMIs

3.  Deploy an Aviatrix Virtual Appliance CloudN in On-Premise


These prerequisites are explained in detail below.

2.1.1  Plan the Cloud Address and create an AWS VPC
---------------------------------------------------


First identify the on-prem subnet from which you plan to migrate VMs. In this example, the subnet is 10.140.0.0/16 with two On-Prem VMs (10.140.0.45 and 10.140.0.46.)

(In this illustration, the cloud subnet is a public subnet. There are other `design patterns <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/design_pattern_ipmotion.html>`_ you can follow.)

Then create an AWS VPC with a public subnet that has an identical CIDR as the on-prem subnet where migration is to take place. For example, create a VPC CIDR 10.140.0.0/16 with a public subnet 10.140.0.0/16 in region Oregon. Note that it is not necessary for the migrated VMs to have public IP addresses.

===============================    ================================================================================
**AWS Example Setting**            **Value**
===============================    ================================================================================
Cloud Type                         AWS
Region                             Oregon
VPC CIDR                           10.140.0.0/16
Public Subnet                      10.140.0.0/16
===============================    ================================================================================

2.1.2  Setup AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) to create a migrated AMI
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please refer to "AWS Server Migration Service – Server Migration to the Cloud Made Easy!" for detail.

`AWS Server Migration Service – Server Migration to the Cloud Made Easy!
<https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-server-migration-service-server-migration-to-the-cloud-made-easy/>`_

- Deploy the Server Migration Connector virtual appliance on On-Premise.

===============================    ================================================================================
**vCenter Setting**                **Example**
===============================    ================================================================================
Setup networks                     10.140.0.0/16
===============================    ================================================================================

- Configure the connector on On-Premise.

===============================    ================================================================================
**Connector Setting**              **Example**
===============================    ================================================================================
AWS Region                         US West (Oregon)
===============================    ================================================================================

- Import the server catalog on AWS SMS console

===============================    ================================================================================
**AWS SMS Setting**                **Example**
===============================    ================================================================================
Replication job ID                 VM which will be migrated to cloud (e.g. VM with ip 10.140.0.45)
===============================    ================================================================================

After completing the previous steps, a user is able to view and launch the migrated AMI in below console:

i.) AWS -> Migration -> Server Migration Service

|image1|

ii.) AWS -> Compute -> EC2 -> Launch Instance

|image2|

Please confirm that the migrated AMI is ready on AWS console.
This document will describe how to integrate the migrated AMI with IPMotion feature in 3.2.2 Step b.

2.1.3  Deploy an Aviatrix Virtual Appliance CloudN in On-Premise subnet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Aviatrix Virtual Appliance CloudN must be deployed and setup in the on-prem subnet where you plan to migrate VMs prior to configuring IPMotion. For example, the subnet is 10.140.0.0/16. Please refer to "Virtual Appliance CloudN" on how to deploy the Virtual Appliance CloudN.

`Virtual Appliance CloudN
<http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/CloudN-Startup-Guide.html>`_

Check and make sure you can access the Aviatrix Virtual Appliance CloudN dashboard and
login with an administrator account. The default URL for the Aviatrix
Virtual Appliance CloudN is:

https://<private ip of Aviatrix Virtual Appliance CloudN>


2.2 Configuration Steps
-----------------------

Make sure the pre-configuration steps in the previous section are completed before proceeding.


2.2.1 Step a – Deploy Aviatrix IPMotion gateway
-----------------------------------------------

The first step is to deploy an Aviatrix IPMotion gateway in AWS VPC.
