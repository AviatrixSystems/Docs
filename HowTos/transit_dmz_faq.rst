Transit DMZ FAQ
=========================================================

What is Transit DMZ?
-----------------------

Transit DMZ is a security feature for the Next Gen Transit network. With Transit DMZ, you can centrally deploy instance based
firewall virtual appliances to protect traffic between on-prem and VPCs, and VPC Egress and Ingress. Transit DMZ is 
implemented at the edge VPC as shown below, where a pair of firewalls are deployed between two pairs of Aviatrix Transit GWs at the Transit VPC edge.

How is Transit DMZ different from the traditional deployment of firewalls in the cloud?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traditionally, centrally deployed instance based firewall appliances require IPSEC tunnels to send traffic from VPCs to these appliances. This increases the complexity of managing the firewalls and reduces performances for the security
features that you want them to perform. 

Transit DMZ decouples networking functions and security functions. There is no IPSEC tunnels between the Aviatrix 
Transit GW and the firewall appliances, thus simplifying firewall deployment and allowing them to scale independently.  

Can Transit DMZ work with Transit VPC?
---------------------------------------

Since Transit DMZ is independent from how a Spoke VPC is connected, it works with both the 
Transit VPC where a Spoke VPC deploys Aviatrix gateways and the Native TGW Spoke VPCs 
where no Aviatrix gateway is deployed in the Spoke VPC. 

Is Transit DMZ a bump in the wire for all traffic?
---------------------------------------------------

For the 4.1 release, Transit DMZ can only intercepts traffic between north and south (on-prem and VPCs) and Egress and Ingress traffic. Transit DMZ does not see east west traffic (between two VPCs).

How does Transit DMZ actually work?
------------------------------------

Transit DMZ relies completely on the AWS VPC network infrastructure to work. There is no IPSEC tunnel between the Aviatrix gateways and the firewall appliances. 

Transit DMZ deploys two sets of Aviatrix Transit GWs in the Transit VPC. They are called main gateways and companion gateways. Main gateways are used to interface with the Spoke VPC (with or without TGW) while companion gateways are 
used to interface with on-prem side (via VGW, CloudN or third party appliance), as shown in the diagram below.

Here is how Transit DMZ works:

 1. The companion gateways establishes BGP with downstream device, such as VGW, CloudN or a third party router.
 #. The learned routes from the companion gateway via BGP is forwarded to the Controller. 
 #. The Controller then distributes the routes to all Spoke VPCs and the main gateways. 
 #. From a Spoke VPC point of view, its transit gateway is the main gateway even though the main gateway runs no BGP. 

The Aviatrix Controller monitors the health of the instance based firewall appliances by AWS APIs. When it detects one
firewall instance become not in running state, it triggers an HA failover to direct both the main gateway and the 
companion gateway to point the routes to the backup firewall instance. 

How should the firewall be deployed?
-------------------------------------

A firewall typically has multiple interfaces. In order to deploy EC2 based firewall appliances, 
you need to create or allocate at least two subnets in the Transit VPC. One subnet for the firewall interface that 
works forwards packet to the main gateways, another subnet for the firewall interface that forwards packet to the companion gateway, as shown in the diagram below.

Aviatrix Controller will create VPC route tables to associate the firewall subnets and create necessary route entries 
for packet forwarding.
