Multi-cloud Transit Gateway Peering over Private Network Workflow
==================================================================

Introduction
============

Aviatrix Transit Gateway Peering over Private Network feature expands Transit Gateway peering to across multi-clouds where there is a private network connectivity between the cloud providers via on-prem or a co-location. This enables customers to build high performance data networks while ensuring data privacy by encrypting data in motion. 

The solution applies to AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute, and Google Cloud Interconnect for the cloud to on-prem connectivity. 

This document describes a step-by-step instruction on how to build Aviatrix Transit Gateway Peering with Private Network over AWS Direct Connect and Azure ExpressRoute for R6.2 and later releases. In this note, you learn the following:

.. important::

	- Aviatrix Transit Gateway Peering over Private Network solution supports only High-Performance Encryption (Insane) mode where Aviatrix Transit Gateways have Insane Mode Encryption option enabled at the gateway launch time.
	
	- This solution supports only `ActiveMesh 2.0 <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/activemesh_faq.html#what-is-activemesh-2-0>`_, please check this doc `How to migrate to ActiveMesh 2.0 <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/activemesh_faq.html#how-to-migrate-to-activemesh-2-0>`_ for migration detail.
	
	- Private subnets reachability between two Transit CIDRs is customers' responsibility which is typically done by Colo providers.
	
	- Workflow on building underlay connectivity for private network with AWS Direct Connect/Azure ExpressRoute here is just an example. Please adjust the topology depending on your requirements.
	
Topology
====================

|transit_gateway_peering_with_private_network_diagram|

The key ideas for this solution are:
-------------------------------------

  - The edge (WAN) router runs a BGP session to AWS VGW via AWS Direct Connect where the edge router advertises the Azure Transit VNET CIDR and the AWS VGW advertises the AWS Transit VPC CIDR.
  
  - The edge (WAN) router runs a BGP session to Azure VNG via Azure ExpressRoute where the edge router advertises the AWS Transit VPC CIDR and the Azure VNG advertises the AZURE Transit VNET CIDR.
  
  - The edge (WAN) router redistributes AWS Transit VPC CIDR and AZURE Transit VNET CIDR.
	
  - Once the reachability between two cloud transits over private network is there, user is able to deploy Aviatrix Multi Cloud Global Transit Gateway Encrypted Peering over Private Network
  
.. important::

  - Reachability between two transit networks' private CIDR is the responsibility of customer.

Prerequisite
