Aviatrix FireNet Inspection End to End traffic Troubleshooting Playbook
=========================================================================================

This technical note provides a step-by-step tips and simple topology to troubleshoot Aviatrix FireNet Inspection End to End traffic

Prerequisite Setup
------------------

Topology:

* TGW * 1

* Security Domain * 3

  * Firewall Domain * 1
  
    ::
      
      Example:
      FIRENET-SD
  
  * Spoke Domain * 2
  
    ::
      
      Example:
      CLIENT-SD and SERVER-SD

* Spoke VPC * 2

  ::
    
    Example:
    Spoke VPC 10.60.0.0/16
    Spoke VPC 10.61.0.0/16

* Aviatrix Firenet gateway * 1

* Firewall * 1

  ::
  
    Example:
    Palo Alto Firewall

* FireNet VPC * 1

  ::
  
    Example:
    FireNet VPC 10.66.0.0/16

Deployment:

  * Follow `Aviatrix Firewall Network workflow <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_workflow.html>`_ to launch FireNet Security Domain, FireNet gateways and firewall instances.

  * Follow `Aviatrix TGW Orchestrator Plan workflow <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_plan.html>`_ to:
  
    * create Spoke Security Domains
    
      ::
      
        Example:
        CLIENT-SD and SERVER-SD
    
    * build Connection policy between the CLIENT-SD domain and the SERVER-SD domain. 
	  
    * build Connection policy between CLIENT-SD domain and Firewall domain so that traffic in and out of the domain is inspected. 
    
  * Follow `Aviatrix TGW Orchestrator Build workflow <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_build.html>`_ to:
    
    * attach Spoke VPC 10.60.0.0/16 to CLIENT-SD to the TGW

    * attach Spoke VPC 10.61.0.0/16 to SERVER-SD  to the TGW


Workflow:
---------

1. Check basic information - Cloud Permission, Aviatrix Controller, and Aviatrix Gateway

      `Cloud Permission - AWS IAM Service Troubleshooting Playbook <https://github.com/brycewang03/Docs/blob/troubleshooting_playbook/HowTos/troubleshooting_playbook_aws_iam_service.rst>`_
   
      `Aviatrix Controller Troubleshooting Playbook <https://github.com/brycewang03/Docs/blob/troubleshooting_playbook/HowTos/troubleshooting_playbook_aviatrix_controller.rst>`_
      
      `Aviatrix Gateway Troubleshooting Playbook <https://github.com/brycewang03/Docs/blob/troubleshooting_playbook/HowTos/troubleshooting_playbook_aviatrix_gateway.rst>`_
    
2. Troubleshoot FireNet Deployment configuration

  * Aviatrix
  
    Check Connection Policy
    
      https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_faq.html#what-is-a-connection-policy
  
      `Check Connection Policy from TGW Orchestrator View`_
      
      `Check Connection Policy from TGW Orchestrator Plan`_
			
			`Check Connection Policy from TGW Orchestrator List`_
      
    Check routing info in Cloud Platform which is related to TGW Orchestrator
      
      `Check routing info in Cloud Platform from TGW Orchestrator Audit`_
      
      `Check routing info in Cloud Platform from TGW Orchestrator Test`_
      
      `Check routing info for Spoke Security Domain in Cloud Platform from TGW Orchestrator List`_
			
			`Check routing info for FireNet Security Domain in Cloud Platform from TGW Orchestrator List`_
      
    `Check basic Firewall Network configuration from Firewall Network Advanced`_
     
    `Check routing info in Cloud Platform which is related to Firewall Network`_
   
    `Check routing info in Aviatrix FireNet Gateway from Firewall Network Advanced`_
      
		`Check routing info in Firewall from Firewall Network`_

  * Cloud Platform
	
		`Check routing info for TGW Orchestrator feature from AWS portal`_
      
		`Check Aviatrix gatewayâ€™s instance level and network level for FireNet feature from AWS portal`_
			
		`Check Firewall instance level and network level for FireNet feature from AWS portal`_
            
3. Troubleshoot connectivity between end device and end device

	`T_01. Verify Internet layer by sending ICMP traffic from end device in Client Spoke Security Domain to the end device in Server Spoke Security Domain with IP`_

	`T_02. Verify Transport layer by sending traffic from end device in Client Spoke Security Domain to the end device in Server Spoke Security Domain with IP/Protocol/Port`_

	`T_03. Verify real traffic between end to end devices`_
