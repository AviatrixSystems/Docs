=========================================================
AWS Transit Gateway Orchestrator Build
=========================================================

At the Build stage, you attach VPCs to an AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) and security domain. Each VPC can only be attached to one security domain. 

The AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) Orchestrator Build workflow is a one step instruction to attach a VPC to an AWS Transit Gateway and a security domain.

For background information, refer to the `TGW Orchestrator FAQ <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_faq.html>`_.

Before you can attach VPCs, you must have at least completed `Step 1 <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_plan.html#create-aws-tgw>`_ in Plan page. 


1. Attach VPC to TGW
-------------------------------------------


====================================================      ==========
**Setting**                                               **Value**
====================================================      ==========
Region                                                    Select a region where AWS Transit Gateway resides.
VPC Account                                               An `Aviatrix account <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/aviatrix_account.html#account>`_ that corresponds to an IAM role or account in AWS. 
VPC Name                                                  Select a VPC in the VPC Account.
TGW Account                                               Select an access account where AWS Transit Gateway resides. 
TGW Name                                                  The name of the AWS Transit Gateway in the AWS Transit Gateway Account. 
Security Domain Name                                      Select from a drop down menu domain. 
Advanced (Optional) Select Subnets                        Available in R4.3 and later. When selected, a drop down menu of VPC subnets appears for you to multi select subnets/AZs should be attached to the VPC. For a MAC keyboard, use Command key and select. For a Window's machine keyboard, use Control key and select. When not selected, Aviatrix Controller automatically select a subnet representing each AZ for the VPC attachment. 
Advanced (Optional) Customize Spoke VPC Routes            Available in R4.7 and later. When you customize the Spoke VPC route entries, no learned routes are programmed into the VPC route table. If you wish no route to be programmed by Aviatrix Orchestrator, enter 0.0.0.0/32.
Advanced (Optional) Select Route Tables                   Available in R5.0 and later. Only the selected route tables will participate in TGW Orchestrator, i.e., learned routes will be propagated to these route tables. 
Advanced (Optional) Disable Local Route Propagation       Available in R5.0 and later. When selected, the Spoke VPC CIDR is not propagated to the TGW route table. 
====================================================      ==========


For example, you can attach a VPC to prod_domain created at the Plan page, as shown below. 

|prod_vpc_attach|

2. Detach VPC from TGW
--------------------------------------------------

This step detaches a VPC from a AWS Transit Gateway and Domain.
