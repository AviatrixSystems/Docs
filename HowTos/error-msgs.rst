This document records Aviatrix error messages, possible root causes and solutions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  [Aviatrix Error] Egress-FireNet-oregon enables East-west inspection. It conflicts with tgw-0af3e281d06d363d4 existing firewall policy. If there are multiple Firewall domains or Transit DMZ that enable traffic inspection, please make sure egress_domain is completely isolated from the other firewall domain.

This is probably caused by two firewall domains both wanting to inspect the same VPC traffic. Only one firewall domain
can inspect east-west traffic the other inspects egress. 

You can fix this by going to Firewall Network -> Advanced. Select the firewall domain, disable "Traffic Inspection, 
and enable "Egress through Firewall". Then go back and execute Step 6 in Firewall Network workflow. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  [Aviatrix Error] Only VPN BGP is supported. Go to AWS Console -> VPC -> Site-to-Site VPN Connections to download the configuration file.

TGW VPN configuration downloading is not supported from the Aviatrix Controller console. You can download the configuration by going to the AWS Console -> VPC -> Site-to-Site VPN Connections to download the configuration file. Once the file is downloaded, use the information in the file to configure the remote end of the IPSec VPN.

    Error: [Aviatrix Error] Gateway instance create failed Reason:Quota 'IN_USE_ADDRESSES' exceeded. Limit: 8.0 in region us-central1.

You may have exceeded GCP IN_USE_ADDRESSES limits on this account. By default in GCP, the in-use IP address of a region is 8 (Different GCP project has different quotas limit setting), you can ask for a new quota limit by following `this GCP instruction <https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas#request_quotas>`_.

::

    Error: [Aviatrix Error] LAN interface is not in demo1-oregon-firenet-gw firewall subnet subnet-09f70b0922e5878ce.

When you try to associate firewall instance to FireNet gateway, the firewall's LAN instance must stay in the same subnet with FireNet gateway's firewall subnet. It is recommended to use Aviatrix controller to launch and associate firewall, which guarentee all the subnets and interfaces are correct. If you launch your own firewall, you need to make sure the firewall interfaces are correct.
The firewall subnets/interfaces are created when enable FireNet function on the gateway. If you create firewall instance before enable FireNet function, those instances can not associate with gateway due to mismatched interface. One way to solve this is to use REST-API to enable FireNet function, and provide existing subnets as option. Please refer to API doc. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------

::

    Error: [Aviatrix Error] Gateway instance create failed Reason:Quota 'IN_USE_ADDRESSES' exceeded. Limit: 8.0 in region us-central1.
