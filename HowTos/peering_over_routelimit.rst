Peering Over Route Limit
========================

This document explains how to set up Aviatrix `encrypted peering <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/peering.html#encrypted-peering>`_ that overcomes AWS route limits. 

Click `here <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#designated-gateway>`_ to learn about Designated Gateway feature. 

::

 1. At Gateway menu, create a gateway in an existing VPC and make sure the option Designated Gateway is selected.

 2. (Optional) If your VPC CIDR is outside RFC 1918 range (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16), you should expand the Designated Gateway coverage by editing the Designated Gateway. Highlight the gateway you just created and click Edit. Scroll down to find "Edit Designated Gateway" section, follow the instructions to add additional CIDR ranges.

 3. Repeat the step 1 and step 2 for a different VPC/VNet.

 4. (Optional) To enable Peering HA, go to Peering -> Encrypted Peering -> New peering, 
    select the two gateways launched in the previous two steps. 

    select "Enable HA" if you wish to build a backup encrypted tunnel for HA. 
    Note that you must first create two respective backup gateways prior to this step. 

    To launch backup gateways, go to the Gateway page, select the gateway, click Edit, 
    At "Gateway for High Availability Peering" field, select one public subnet 
    and click Create. 

 4. Go to Peering -> Encrypted Peering, click New Peering to peer the two
   gateways.
