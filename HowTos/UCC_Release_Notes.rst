========================

1. Multi-cloud Transit Network
---------------------------------

- **Active-Standby Mode on ActiveMesh 2.0** provides the flexibility on Aviatrix Transit Gateways to connect to on-prem with only one active tunnel and the other one as backup. The use case is a deployment scenario where on-prem device such as firewalls does not support asymmetric routing on two tunnels. When Active-Standby mode is enabled, it applies to both BGP and Static Remote Route Based `External Device Connections <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitgw_external.html>`_ and for each connection, only one tunnel is active in forwarding traffic at any given time. To configure, go to Multi-cloud Transit -> Advanced Config, select the Aviatrix Transit Gateway to enable Active-Standby. For more information, refer to `Active-Standby <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_advanced.html#active-standby>`_.

- **Segmentation based BGP CIDRs Advertisements** advertises only those Spoke CIDRs that have connection policy to a specific on-prem connection. For example, consider a multi-tenant deployment where Aviatrix Transit Gateway connects to multiple on-prem sites over BGP, each site connecting to a set of Spokes through `AWS TGW Edge Segmentation <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_faq.html#what-is-edge-segmentation>`_ or `Multi-cloud Segmentation <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_segmentation_faq.html#what-is-multi-cloud-transit-segmentation>`_. With this new feature, Aviatrix Transit Gateway only advertises Spoke CIDRs that are relevant to the on-prem site. This behavior is enabled as the default when launching a new Transit Gateway. For existing deployment, you can enable it by going to Multi-cloud Transit -> Advanced Config, select an Aviatrix Transit Gateway, scroll down to `Refresh BGP Advertise Network Routes`. 

- **Multi-cloud Transit Gateway Peering over Private Network** expands Transit Gateway peering over multi-cloud where there is private network connectivity cross cloud. One use case is two Aviatrix Transit Gateways deployed in two different public cloud where each has its private connectivity such as AWS Direct Connect and Azure Express Route connecting to on-prem or a co-location. By building a high performance Transit Gateway private peering, Aviatrix Transit Gateway forwards traffic over the private links to the other Aviatrix Transit Gateway and beyond with encryption for data in motion. To configure, go to Multi-cloud Transit -> Transit Peering -> +Add New. Select the option Peering over Private Network for a new peering connection. For an example configuration, refer to `Multi-cloud Transit Peering over Private Networks <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_gateway_peering_with_private_network_workflow.html>`_.

- **Insane Mode in GCP** is now available for Multi-cloud Transit solution. For performance benchmark, refer to `GCP Insane Mode performance test results <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/insane_mode_perf.html#gcp-performance-test-results>`_. Insane Mode is enabled when launching a new Aviatrix Transit Gateway or Spoke gateway in GCP. 

- **Managed CloudN Appliance** simplifies CloudN configuration and operation by allowing it to be managed by the Controller. Active-Active deployment model supports up to 25Gbps encryption performance. Refer to `Managed CloudN workflow <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_workflow.html>`_.

- **Custom Mapped Site2Cloud in Spoke** solves all issues of overlapping network addresses with remote networks by expanding Site2Cloud `Mapped <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/site2cloud.html#connection-type-mapped>`_ function in a Spoke. 

- **TGW with Multicast capability** allows you to launch an AWS TGW with multicast capability. A use case is to support applications running on multicast protocols. API support only.

- **Update Attached Spoke VNet CIDR** allows you to update Spoke VNet CIDR when there is a change without having to detach the Spoke and attach again, thus removing any down time or outage. API support only.

- **Default Tagging in Azure** adds Aviatrix default tag when Controller creates resources such as launching an Aviatrix gateway, create route entries, load balancer and route tables.  

- **Enhancement in Creating a VNet** defines public and private subnets and their associated route tables. This helps clarify how Aviatrix Controller manages route table and their programming. For details, refer to `Aviatrix Default Route Handling <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/default_route_faq.html>`_.

- **Default Routing Handling** enforces rules on how Aviatrix Controller handles the propagation and programming of cloud networks. Specifically the Controller only overwrite the default route on private subnets. For details, refer to `Aviatrix Default Route Handling <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/default_route_faq.html>`_. 


2. FireNet
-------------

- **FireNet 2-tuple Forwarding Algorithm Support** expands FireNet forwarding algorithm to include forwarding decision based on only the source and destination IP address. One use case is to support an application where multiple TCP sessions are used for an egress Internet service therefore requiring all sessions to go through one firewall with the same source NAT IP address. To configure, go to Firewall Network -> Advanced. Select the FireNet gateway, click the 3 dots skewer, scroll down to Firewall Forwarding, select 2-Tuple. For more information, refer to `Firewall Forwarding Algorithms <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_advanced.html#firewall-hashing>`_.  

- **Centralized FQDN on Azure FireNet** allows Aviatrix FQDN gateways to be deployed in FireNet solution in Azure. One use case is to consolidate egress control to reduce cost with centralized statistical multiplexing. To configure, go to Firewall Network -> Setup -> 7c. For more information, refer to `Launch & Associate Aviatrix FQDN gateway <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_workflow.html#c-launch-associate-aviatrix-fqdn-gateway>`_. 

- **Bootstrap support in Azure FireNet on Palo Alto Networks VM-Series, Check Point and FortiGate** simplifies FireNet deployment in Azure. For details, refer to `VM-Series bootstrap in Azure <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/pan_bootstrap_example_azure.html>`_, `Check Point bootstrap in Azure <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/checkpoint_bootstrap_azure.html>`_ and `FortiGate bootstrap in Azure <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/fortigate_bootstrap_example_azure.html>`_. 

- **Bootstrap support in AWS FireNet on Check Point and FortiGate** simplifies FireNet deployment in AWS. For details, refer to `Check Point bootstrap in AWS <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/checkpoint_bootstrap_azure.html>`_ and `FortiGate bootstrap in AWS <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/fortigate_bootstrap_example.html>`_. 


3. Operations
------------------

- **Discover Unencrypted Flows** is a useful tool to provide visibility on any non TCP port 443 and port 22 traffic running in a VPC in AWS. By running, recording and analyzing VPC flow logs in an on-demand fashion, this tool helps infrastructure engineers to understand application traffic patterns without cost incurring for long running VPC Flow Logs. By excluding TCP port 443 and port 22 traffic, the tool highlights any unencrypted traffic in the network.  

- **Session Visibility** displays active connection sessions running through Aviatrix gateways. This is useful for troubleshooting connectivity issue. To view sessions, go to Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> Gateway -> Session View. Or go to Security -> Stateful Firewall -> Session View.

=======================

1. Multi-cloud Network
--------------------------------

- **Scale out Firewalls in Azure FireNet** allows FireNet to support multiple firewall virtual machines in Azure. The use case is to support more than 2 firewall deployment to meet performance requirements. Only new FireNet gateways in Azure supports scale out firewall feature. Refer to `this document <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_firenet_workflow_azure.html>`_.

- **Azure GovCloud** is now supported for both Controller and Aviatrix gateways. Controller can be launched from Azure GovCloud marketplace. Follow `Azure Startup Guide <https://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/azure-aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_ to get started. 


- **Prepend ASN on BGP Connection** expands Prepend ASN to specific BGP connection. Previously the ASN prepend applies to the entire Aviatrix Transit Gateway, this feature brings the flexibility to prepend different ASN for different BGP connections. The use case is to provide more flexibility on the Aviatrix Transit Gateway to influence the next hop selection of the upstream BGP neighbour. To configure, go to Multi-Cloud Transit -> Advanced Config. Select an Aviatrix Transit Gateways, scroll down to Connection AS PATH Prepend, select a connection and enter one or more enter AS numbers separated by space. For more details, refer to `Connection AS PATH Prepend <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_advanced.html#connection-as-path-prepend>`_. 

- **Multi-cloud Segmentation Enhancement** now handles egress default route in a consistent way by introducing individual route tables for each Security Domain on an Aviatrix Multi-cloud Transit Gateway. This release is not backward compatible to the implementation in Release 6.0. To migrate, `disable Multi-cloud Segmentation <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_segmentation_workflow.html#disable-aviatrix-transit-gateway-for-segmentation>`_ on each Aviatrix Transit Gateway, upgrade to Release 6.1 and `enable <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_segmentation_workflow.html#enable-aviatrix-transit-gateway-for-segmentation>`_ again. To learn more on deployment limitation, refer to `this link. <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_segmentation_faq.html#what-is-the-limitation-of-segmentation>`_ 

- **FireNet Check Point Integration Enhancement** now support Check Point firewall or security gateway automatic route updates to its routing tables by the Controller. You no longer need to statically configure RFC 1918 or any other routes.

- **FireNet for AWS TGW Inter Region Traffic Inspection** allows you to specifically inspect traffic crossing TGW Peering regions. One use case is in certain deployment, it is not desirable to specify all traffic going in and out of a Security Domain, rather the requirement is to only inspect traffic that moves across the regions. For configuration details, refer to `Inspect Inter Region Traffic <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_plan.html#inspect-inter-region-traffic>`_.

2. Security
----------------

- **Auto PrivateS3** significantly improves PrivateS3 usability and security by automatically retrieving S3 bucket names for PrivateS3 filtering. One use case is to support large set of S3 buckets owned by organizations without having to manually import into the Controller. The second use case is to prevent accidental or intentional manual  input S3 buckets that are not owned by organization. For workflow, check out `PrivateS3 workflow <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/privateS3_workflow.html>`_.

- **Subnets Pass-through** allows you to specify certain subnets in a VPC to bypass any FQDN filter rules. One use case is that certain subnets, for example,  are for Dev environment, therefore does not require to be FQDN filtered or logged. To configure, go to Security -> Egress Control -> Egress FQDN Gateway View. Select a gateway, click Actions -> Edit Pass-through. Select subnet or multi select subnets to allow bypass the filter. For more details, refer to `FQDN Source Pass-through <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/fqdn_viewlog.html#edit-pass-through>`_.

- **Exact Port Match** now applies to each FQDN rule. One use case is if you only specify an FQDN rule for TCP port 443, packets with the same FQDN rule for TCP port 80 are dropped unless you have the specific FQDN rule on TCP port 80. This is a bug fix, no configuration required. For more information, refer to `Exact Match <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/FQDN_Whitelists_Ref_Design.html#exact-match>`_. 

- **FQDN Option for Exact Match** is a new feature where if a FQDN rule does not have * an exact match is expected. If this global option is not enabled, FQDN rules use regex to match any FQDN names that are subset of the name. For example, if salesforce.com is a rule and Exact Match option is enabled, finance.salesforce.com is not a match and will be dropped. For configuration details, refer to `FQDN Exact Match <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/FQDN_Whitelists_Ref_Design.html#exact-match>`_. 


3. Operations
-----------------

- **Account Name Alias** allows you to change the account name after it is created by providing an alias name and allowing it to be modified at any given time. The use case is customers often need to change some account names after the network has been built out to certain scale. By allowing account name alias to be modified without having to delete the account and thus reduces network downtime. To change account name alias, go to Accounts -> Access Accounts, hover the mouse at a specific account, click the Pen icon and start typing. Refer to `this document <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/aviatrix_account.html#setup-account-name-alias>`_.

- **Gateway Name Alias** allow you to change an Aviatrix gateway name after it is created by providing an alias name and allowing it to be modified at any time. The use case is customers often need to change some gateway names after the network has been built out to certain scale. By allowing gateway name alias to be modified without having to delete the gateway and thus reduces network downtime. To change gateway name alias, go to Gateway, hover the mouse at a specific gateway name, click the Pen icon and start typing. Note the original gateway name is still maintained as "Original Name". Refer to `this document <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#gateway-name-alias>`_. Note this feature does not interoperate with Co-Pilot at this time. For customers who deploy Co-Pilot, making changes the gateway names breaks Co-Pilot. The work around is not to use this feature or change back the gateway name. 


- **Create a VPC Enhancement** now creates multiple route tables associated with public and private subnets. One use case is to allow traffic load balancing when Aviatrix Spoke gateways are deployed. To configure, go to Useful Tools -> Create a VPC. For more details, check out `Create a VPC <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/create_vpc.html>`_.
 
- **Controller Access Security on Azure** extends the Access Security feature to Azure. When an Aviatrix gateway is launched, security rule is automatically added to the Controller inbound rule. This allows Controller admin to only open inbound TCP port 443 to Aviatrix gateways and no-prem public IP addresses, thus improving Controller security. To configure, go to Settings -> Controller -> Access Security. Select the Controller account and enable. For more details, refer to `Enable Controller Security Group Management <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/FAQ.html#enable-controller-security-group-management>`_.  

- **Login Banner** allows you to customize banner text for first time login for compliance. Any user who login for the first time must acknowledge the text before proceeding to Controller. To configure, go to Settings -> Controller -> Login Customization -> Login Banner. For more information, refer to `Login Banner <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/controller_config.html#login-banner>`_.

4. User VPN

 - **Bug fix** The profile attribute handling for SAML user VPN client did not consider error cases when profile attribute is absent or does not produce a match. 
 

R4.7.581 (8/11/2019)
=======================

 - **Transit peering for two transit gateways in the same VPC** removes the constraint that Transit Peering can only take place on two Aviatrix Transit Gateway in two different VPCs. The use case is if you have deployed two individual transit networks in the same VPC, now you can connect them by implementing Transit Gateway Peering. 


R4.7.501 (7/22/2019)
=======================

 - **Software update for Field Notice 0005** as described in `this document  <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/field_notices.html#field-notice-0005-2019-07-22>`_.

R4.7.378 (6/16/2019)
=====================

1. AWS Transit Gateway Orchestrator
-------------------------------------

 - **AWS TGW Egress/Ingress Domain** allows you to create a central egress network architecture without requiring to launch Aviatrix FireNet gateway. Aviatrix Orchestrator programs the necessary Spoke VPC route tables and TGW route tables to make sure Internet bound traffic from Spoke VPCs are forwarded to the VPC in egress domain. One use case for native egress domain is to reduce the number of EIPs you may have to whitelist to accessing third party SaaS service. In the egress domain, you can deploy `Aviatrix FQDN gateway <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/fqdn_faq.html>`_ or a virtual appliance to handle Internet bound traffic. Note in this network architecture, there is no built in scale out and redundancy as it is the case for Aviatrix Firewall Network. To configure, select "Native Egress/Ingress Domain" when `creating a New Security Domain <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_plan.html#create-a-new-security-domain>`_ at the TGW Orchestrator Plan. 

 - **AWS TGW Firewall Domain** provides the firewall network architecture without requiring to launch Aviatrix FireNet gateway. Aviatrix Orchestrator programs the necessary Spoke VPC route tables and TGW route tables to make sure traffic that requires inspection is forwarded to the firewall security domain. One use case is to run a virtual appliance for packet inspection. Note in this network architecture, there is no built in scale out and redundancy as it is the case for Aviatrix Firewall Network architecture. To configure, select "Native Firewall Domain" when `creating a New Security Domain <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_plan.html#create-a-new-security-domain>`_ at the TGW Orchestrator Plan.

 - **Customize Spoke VPC Route Table** allows you to program route entries in Spoke VPC route table that points to TGW as target. By default, Aviatrix Orchestrator programs RFC 1918 routes in the VPC route table to point to TGW, any routes that are outside of this range is dynamically programmed into the VPC route table. When you enable this feature, all dynamic route propagation will be stopped. One use case is if you simply want to program the default route to point to TGW. Another use case is if you do not wish Aviatrix Orchestrator to program any VPC routes, in which case you should enter 0.0.0.0/32 for the "Customizing Spoke VPC Rotues" field. To configure, enter a list of comma separated CIDRs at `Attach VPC to TGW <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_build.html#attach-vpc-to-tgw>`_ during TGW Orchestrator Build. 

 - **Customize TGW VPN Creation** with additional parameters, such as inside_ip_cidr and pre_shared_key. For more information, checkout the API `Attach Native VPN to TGW <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/avx-apidoc/index.htm>`_.

2. Insane Mode Enhancement
----------------------------

 - **Insane Mode Dynamic Bandwidth Adjustment** significantly reduces Insane Mode tunnel switch over probability by automatically removing the failed encryption lane from the load balancing pool while keeping the remaining encryption lanes to continue to forward the traffic. After the failed lane is brought back up, it is then added back to the load balancing pool. Only when 50% of the lanes fail should the Controller declare the tunnel down and switch over to the backup tunnel.  

3. FQDN Enhancement
---------------------------------

 - **Performance Enhancement** to handle traffic burst. FQDN and system memory pool are significantly increased to handle large burst traffic.

R2.7
==========

1. Controller 
-------------------

- Console Responsiveness improvements. Significant improvements in page responsiveness when using controller web console. 

- Support third party signed certificate. You now can import a third party signed certificate to the controller. This should remove the "Not Secure" sign displayed by the browser. To configure, go to Settings -> Advanced -> Certificate -> CERTIFICATE IMPORT. First Enable Certificate Checking. The console will ask you to enter a domain name and generate a CSR file (Certificate Signing Request). Send this CSR to get singed, then import both CA and server certificate. Note if intermediate certificate is one of the return files, use the intermediate certificate file for CA import. 


2. Connectivity
-------------------

- Support Site2Cloud tunnel on TCP. In addition to run IPSEC tunnel on UDP protocol, you can now run on TCP 443. This option removes the requirements of having to open site firewall ports on UDP 4500/500. To configure, go to Site2Cloud -> Add New. Select TCP for Tunnel Type selection. 

3. Scalability
---------------

- Support load balancing UDP based OpenVPN® gateways. If your OpenVPN® users experience slow terminal response or long file transfer time, use UDP based VPN gateway can help. This release allows you to create multiple UDP based VPN gateways and load balance them in a round robin fashion by leveraging AWS Route53. To configure, go to OpenVPN® -> Advanced -> UDP Loadbalancer. Note with UDP protocol UDP port 1194 is used. When using from on-prem, firewall port UDP 1194 must be open. 

- Support Designated Gateway. If you are planning to have a large set of tunnels going through a gateway or are hitting AWS route entry limit, this feature is for you. If "Designated Gateway" option is selected at the gateway launch time, the Controller programs 3 route entries based on RFC1918 for the gateway. Controller will not program additional route entries when configure a VPN tunnel that end on the Designated Gateway. Note if you currently do not have a Designated Gateway and you are hitting route entry limit, launch a new gateway with Designated Gateway enabled and configure future tunnels from the Designated Gateway. Note there can only be one Designated Gateway per VPC. Designated Gateway only supports Gateway HA.  

4. Modular Configuration
--------------------------

- Allocate New EIP. When this option is selected at new gateway launch time, Controller always allocates a new EIP from AWS and associated it with the gateway. If this option is unchecked, Controller will first look at the EIP pool that belong to the account: if there is allocated but unassociated EIP, Controller will allocate EIP from this pool and associate it with the gateway, otherwise it will select one EIP from the pool and associate it with the gateway. 

- Support resizing active Gateway without deleting its peering tunnel. You can resize an active gateway when there peering HA configured. The workflow should be: 1) Settings -> Gateways -> select the gateway, select Edit. 2) Select it desired gateway instance size, click Change. As the result of this function, the gateway will be stopped and tunnel switch to backup tunnel. 3) Go to Settings -> Peering, select the peer and click Force Switchover.  

- Support resizing UDP based OpenVPN® gateway instance.

UDP based encrypted tunnel is still supported. 

- Reserve on-prem segment for Datacenter Extension feature of CloudN. After deciding how many VPCs you wish to configure during on boarding, you can sub divide the segments to reserve some for on prem VM deployment. This allows you launch applications where some part of it (such as database) is on-prem and others parts of it (such as web front end) to be in VPC.  

- Google IDP support. Google IDP is now supported IDP for the Aviatrix SAML VPN solution. 

Security
---------

7. New Aviatrix OVF for VMWare
-------------------------------

-  Visit download.aviatrix.com

UserConnect-031717
==================

Security
--------

-  First release to white list public Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN
   filtering) for egress HTTP and HTTPS traffic to Internet initiated by
   instances on private subnets in a VPC. The FQDNs can be specified
   with regex wild card, such as \*.example.com. A tag is defined as a
   list of FQDNs and one or more gateways is attached to a tag. Any
   updates to a tag automatically triggers updates to all gateways
   attached to the tag. Multiple tags can be defined on the controller.
   This feature works together with Gateway Security Policy feature
   where private network, IP address, protocol and ports can be
   filtered.

   To configure, go to "Advanced Config" -> "FQDN Filter". The workflow
   is 1) create a tag, 2) Click Enable to enable the tag, 3) Edit the
   tag by adding FQDN hostname part of URLs (e.g.
   `www.aviatrix.com <http://www.aviatrix.com>`__, or \*.google.com),
   and 4) Attach Gateway. One or more gateways can be attached to a tag.
   Step 1), 3) and 4) can be done first and then Enable the tag. Once
   the tag is enabled, HTTP and HTTPS traffic to these FQDN will be
   allowed, and any destination outside the FQDN will be denied.

   Note the gateway with FQDN must have NAT enabled for Internet egress
   traffic.

   Caveat: in this release FQDN filter is not failover capable when
   peering HA is configured.

Monitor and Troubleshooting
---------------------------

-  During UCC gateway launch, Controller now reports in text the
   progress of gateway creation in addition to the progress bar view.

-  “Dry Run” for system upgrade. Dry Run performs health checks for the
   Controller and gateways to detect potential upgrade failure without
   executing the command. Go to Settings -> Upgrade. Optionally, click
   Dry Run. If it is successful, you may click Upgrade.

-  Dashboard now displays a summary packet statistics per gateway. Click
   on a specific gateway, top 10 packet statistics of the gateway are
   also displayed.

-  Support test network connectivity. This is useful to troubleshoot any
   firewall or security policy that blocks connectivity from the
   controller or gateway. To test, go to Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics ->
   "Network Connectivity Utility". Select either Controller or one
   gateway and test if it can reach a specific port of a remote host.

-  Capability has been added to log tunnel status change notification to
   syslog (in addition to an email notification with the same content).

-  Enhancement has been made for tunnel status alert mechanism by
   allowing users to configure tunnel down detection time. To change the
   detection time, go to Settings -> Tunnels. The default detection time
   is 60 seconds.

-  Capability has been added to check the VPC settings of a specific
   gateway. VPC settings include security groups, route tables, subnets,
   Network ACLs, DHCP options. To configure, go to Troubleshoot -> VPC
   Diagnostics

-  Splunk forwarder has been upgraded from version 6.2 to version 6.4.

Connectivity and High Availability
----------------------------------

-  Support multiple independent UDP based VPN gateways (without ELB)
   within the same VPC. These VPN gateways can have different
   attributes. For example, one gateway has split tunnel configured
   while the other one has full tunnel configured.

-  Support API credential change on controller console for Azure ARM
   accounts when the credential becomes out of sync with the credential
   on cloud provider console. For example, the account credentials are
   changed by the cloud provider or user herself.

-  HA support has been added to Service Chaining with AWS gateways in
   different zones.

-  Support IAM role-based controller and cloud account for AWS GovCloud.
   The Controller must be in GovCloud to create GovCloud gateways with
   IAM role-based accounts.

-  Site2Cloud HA support has been added with CloudN as the on-prem
   device. To configure it, launch two gateways in the same VPC/VNet
   with UCC Controller. Then go to Site2Cloud page to create a new
   connection. Check "Enable HA" and select "Aviatrix" from "Remote
   Gateway Type" list. After creating the site2cloud connection, select
   this connection and download configuration with "Aviatrix" as
   "Vendor". Import the same configuration file at CloudN's Site2Cloud
   page.

Controller Administration
-------------------------

-  Function has been added to notify admin via admin email when a new
   release becomes available.

-  Support has been added to enforce password complexity of account
   users. To enable it, go to Settings -> Security -> "Password
   Management".

-  Support read only (operator) role for Controller management. The read
   only account has dashboard view, status view and list view, but
   cannot make modification to any configuration. To create a read only
   user, go to Accounts -> Account Users -> "New User". Select
   "read\_only" from the dropdown list of "Account Name".

-  CloudN's console password can be changed from the default
   "Aviatrix123#". To do so, type "enable" to enter config mode and then
   issue "change\_console\_password" command.

-  Capability has been added for HTTPS certificate check for control
   traffic between Controller and gateways. To turn on this function, go
   to Settings -> Security -> "Certificate Checking".

-  The following APIs have been added. For details of the complete APIs,
   refer to `API
   Document <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-download/Cloud-Controller/Cloud+Services+Gateway+Controller+API+reference.pdf>`__.

   -  peer\_ha\_switch\_over

   -  upload\_cloudx\_command\_log

   -  upgrade

UserConnect-013017
==================

-  First release of Service Chaining. Service Chaining capability allows
   multiple instance based functions to work in tandem to control
   traffic flow path within an AWS VPC. For example, a firewall instance
   can be service chained with Aviatrix gateway so that EC2 initiated
   traffic will first be sent to firewall for inspection before
   forwarding it to Aviatrix gateway for peering to another VPC. To
   enable the function, go to "Advanced Config" -> "Service Chaining" to
   select the route table and enter "Downstream IP". Aviatrix gateway
   will only modify the selected route table to specify which outgoing
   traffic needs to go through itself and also route the incoming
   traffic to the "Downstream IP" address. Normally, the selected route
   table is associated with the subnet of your firewall's WAN (or
   untrusted) interface. The "Downstream IP" should be the IP address of
   your firewall's WAN interface. For details, check out
   `this <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-download/Cloud-Controller/Aviatrix+Service+Chaining+Reference+Design.pdf>`__
   reference design.

-  Within AWS, support has been added to allow deployment of the UCC
   Controller in VPC's private subnet. To enable this, during the
   Controller's initial setup, when prompted for "If this controller is
   being launched on a private subnet, check the box below, otherwise,
   leave it blank", select "private subnet" and then click the "save"
   button. Please note that when the Controller is deployed in private
   subnet it can only create gateways in private subnets. We assume
   these private subnets in various VPCs can reach each other through
   AWS peering.

-  For AWS, account diagnostics have been added. To run these
   diagnostics, go to Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> "Account
   Diagnostics". This diagnostics command will validate the AWS account
   credentials and check the status of associated gateways and SQS
   queues.

-  There is now support for adding multiple CIDRs separated by commas in
   "Advanced Config"->"Join Function" -> "Allow Subnet" at CloudN.

-  Tunnel HA for Azure ARM gateways can now be created through "Advanced
   Config"->"Join Function". To enable tunnel HA, select a particular
   gateway on the "Gateway" page and then go to "Gateway for High
   Availability Tunnel/Peering" to create a backup gateway.

-  Support has been added to allow the creation of two VPN gateways
   (without ELB) in the same VPC, one with SAML enabled and the other
   one with only certification authentication enabled (no MFA method
   supported on the 2\ :sup:`nd` gateway).

-  The Dashboard now displays the IPSec tunnels created by site2cloud
   connection.

-  Support has been added for enabling NAT on CloudN Controller itself.
   To enable this, go to Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> "NAT
   Configuration".

-  With this release, both the actual public IP address of the
   Controller and the stored public IP address if it is different from
   the actual public IP are displayed. To view these public IP
   addresses, go to Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> "Controller Public
   IP".

-  Proxy server support has been added on the UCC Controller for initial
   download and ongoing communication. During the Controller's initial
   setup, when prompted for "If the controller accesses the Internet
   through a proxy server, provide the following information, otherwise
   leave the fields blank", enter the server URLs for "HTTP Proxy" and
   "HTTPS Proxy". If the proxy server issues a self-signed certificate,
   upload a CA certificate.

-  The ability to setup proxy server setting for Internet connectivity
   in CloudN OVA has been added. To configure proxy server support, use
   "–setup\_network\_only {true\|false}" for clish command
   setup\_interface\_address and setup\_interface\_static\_address. Use
   clish command "setup\_network\_options {test\|save\|cancel}" to
   test/save/remove http/https proxy setting. Currently, "Datacenter
   Extension" and "Join Function" are not supported when proxy server is
   enabled.

-  Traceroute support has been added on gateways. To run "Trace Route",
   go to Troubleshoot -> Logs -> "Traceroute Utility".

-  For site2cloud, users can now select the route tables to be modified
   when "Encryption over ExpressRoute/DirectConnect" is enabled. Only
   subnets associated with the selected route tables will have tunnel
   connections to on-prem. To select route tables, go to Site2Cloud ->
   "Add New" and enable "Encryption over ExpressRoute/DirectConnect".
   Available route tables will show up in the "Route Tables to Modify"
   field.

-  The following APIs have been updated. For details of the complete
   APIs, refer to `API
   Document <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-download/Cloud-Controller/Cloud+Services+Gateway+Controller+API+reference.pdf>`__.

   Profile, Landing Gateway, etc.

-  CloudN "Join" function HA support. Join capability allows you to
   connect to an existing VPC with an IPSec tunnel. To enable HA, go to
   the Gateway page, click the gateway, and enable HA.

-  Remote Syslog enhancement. Enable remote syslog to optionally not be
   encrypted. To configure, go to Settings -> Loggings -> REMOTE SYSLOG,
   simply ignore the "cert" option.

-  Aviatrix SAML VPN client preview for GCloud. The new Aviatrix SAML
   client provides a seamless user experience when authenticating a VPN
   user through a SAML IDP. For customers who use SAML based Single Sign
   On (SSO) for a unified user authentication and access control to
   their applications, this new capability allows them to treat the
   Aviatrix VPN solution as another application that authenticates VPN
   users by an already established mechanism. This preview release has
   been tested on GCloud. Forgerock is the primarily tested IDP and Okta
   has been partially verified. The supported platforms for the Aviatrix
   SAML VPM clients are Mac OSX, Windows 10, and Windows 7.

==================

-  Scale out encrypted peering support for AWS. You can create a cluster
   in a VPC that consists of up to 7 gateways, peering between two
   clusters in two VPCs increases packet throughput. To enable cluster
   encrypted peering, click Cluster Encrypted Peering under Peering tab.
   Preliminary iperf performance test shows TCP packet throughput can
   reach up to 8.5Gbps with bi-directional traffic. For more
   information, check out `Cluster Peering Reference
   Design <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Cluster_Peering_Ref_Design.html>`__

-  Controller HA support. Create a standby controller in any region and
   any cloud (AWS, Azure ARM and GCloud). When the primary controller
   goes down, the standby controller takes over and becomes operational.
   To enable the feature, click Settings -> Controller HA -> Enable.
   Input the standby controller's public IP address. You also need to
   input standby controller's admin username and password for
   authentication purpose.

-  Enhanced peering HA support. The new peering HA feature reduces
   failover to a backup peering to under 2 seconds. To enable the
   feature, click Peering -> Encrypted Peering and enable HA. Note the
   current gateway HA support will be phased out in the future.

-  Transitive peering support for Azure ARM, Azure classic, GCloud and
   Azure China. Built on the earlier release of transitive peering
   support for AWS, this feature is now covered by all cloud types. This
   feature enables you to deploy a hub and spoke architecture of
   multiple VPCs in a simple point and click manner. To enable
   transitive peering, click Peer -> Transitive Peering.

-  Peering Diagnostics support. Troubleshooting peering tunnel status is
   made easy. Click Diag of the specific peer. Options are debug, test
   latency, ping and restart the tunnel.

-  Display the public IP address of the controller. This feature is
   useful for CloudN64 virtual appliance where its public IP address is
   needed for configuring Site2Cloud capability. To view the
   controller's public IP address, click Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics ->
   CONTROLLER PUBLIC IP.

-  Support all Azure ARM regions.

-  Support interoperability of Aviatrix gateway Site2Cloud to AWS VGW
   and Azure VPN Gateway. When configuring Site2Cloud, you can select
   the specific cloud provider VPN gateways to ensure encrypted tunnel
   work correctly.

-  Add API for CloudN64 Join features: allow subnet to VPC and
   delete subnet to VPC. For the complete APIs, refer to `API
   Document <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-download/Cloud-Controller/Cloud+Services+Gateway+Controller+API+reference.pdf>`__

UserConnect-101016
==================

-  Add Mumbai (ap-south-1) to AWS region support list.

-  Support multiple Splunk indexers by importing Splunk config file.
   This enables Aviatrix controller and gateway logs to be integrated
   with multiple Splunk servers that many enterprises deploy. To
   configure, go to Settings -> Loggings -> Splunk. Select Import files
   to import a Splunk configuration file. You may also choose Manual
   Input, in this case each indexer must be listening on the same port.

-  Support DataDog agent for both controller and gateways. To enable, go
   to Settings -> Loggings -> DataDog, provide an API Key.

-  Enhancement for VPN user profile editing: when adding a user to a
   specific profile, only display those who do not belong to the
   profile. When deleting a user to a specific profile, only displays
   users who belong to the profile.

-  Support tooltip for many labels. Move mouse over a label, a detailed
   explanation displays for the label.

UserConnect-092216
==================

-  Support encryption over AWS peering. This capability allows two same
   region VPCs to send encrypted traffic to each other without going
   over Internet by leveraging AWS peering as underlying infrastructure.
   This mechanism significantly reduces data transfer cost. To use this
   feature, customer must configure AWS peering from AWS console between
   the two VPCs in the same region. To enable this feature, go to
   Peering -> Encrypted Peering -> New Peering. Check "Over AWS
   Peering". One use case for this feature is to enable NetApp OnTAP
   software to run in HA mode.

-  Support Azure ARM North Europe region.

-  Support Skyhook for Docker 1.12 release.

UserConnect-090416
==================

-  Support site2cloud use case where the gateway imports a template
   configuration file from a different Aviatrix gateway that initiates
   the configuration. This capability is useful to build IPSEC tunnels
   between two enterprises where each has its own Aviatrix UCC
   controller.

-  Support using Aviatrix CloudN as customer device for site2cloud
   connection. Follow these steps: 1) use UCC Controller to create a
   site2cloud connection by entering CloudN's public IP and subnet CIDRs
   for customer on-prem network. 2) On UCC Controller, select Aviatrix
   as vendor choice to download this site2cloud configuration file. 3)
   go to CloudN's site2cloud page and import the downloaded
   configuration file to establish the site2cloud connection.

-  Allow users to provide an optional IPSec pre-shared key when creating
   site2cloud connections. When the filled is left empty, UCC controller
   will automatically generate a pre-shared key.

-  Support HA for GCloud gateways with a zone selection option.

-  Update API to accommodate GUI 2.0 development

UserConnect-082116
==================

-  Support on GUI 2.0:

   -  Settings -> Change Password

   -  Settings -> Email

   -  Settings -> System Time

   -  OpenVPN® -> Profiles -> Edit -> Add New. Users can select subnets
      from VPCs/VNets without typing these CIDRs manually.

   -  Gateway -> Click "+" next to the gateway name. Users can display
      all VMs inside the gateway's VPC/VNet

-  VPN User list displays user email and associated profile information.

-  Allow users to setup VPN user license threshold notification. When
   license usage exceeds the threshold, email notification will be sent
   out to admin's account.

-  Azure Aviatrix gateway image is available at marketplace. There is no
   need to download gateway image to your storage account before
   launching a gateway. Instead, users need to subscribe to the Aviatrix
   Companion Gateway in Azure marketplace. This new capability
   significantly reduces Azure gateway deployment time. The Aviatrix
   Companion Gateway is free of charge. Please refer to startup guide
   for details.

UserConnect-072216
==================

-  GUI 2.0 becomes production. To access GUI 2.0, go to
   `https://controller\_ip/ <https://controller_ip/preview/>`__. Note:
   Old GUI is still available at https://controller_ip/v1/. All the new
   features developed in this release are only available for GUi 2.0.

-  **(Known issue: After upgrading to UserConnect-072216, the browser
   does not log out properly. You must type in https://controller_ip to
   re-login)**

-  Allow users to specify their own ELB names when creating AWS/GCloud
   VPN gateways. If no ELB name specified by users, Controller will
   provide a default ELB name.

-  Support AWS IAM role. When AWS IAM role is used, there is no need to
   enter AWS access key and secret key when creating a cloud account at
   Controller. Instead, two IAM roles will be created. Controller will
   use the role-based temporary security credentials to request access
   to AWS resources. Cloud account created by IAM role helps to reduce
   the risk of compromising AWS credentials. Please refer to `Aviatrix
   IAM role Configuration
   Guide <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/HowTo_IAM_role.html>`__
   for details.

-  Support AWS Geo VPN to include other cloud type's ELB DNS name. To
   configure, go to OpenVPN® -> Configuration to enable AWS Geo VPN
   first. Then you can add ELB DNS names from other cloud types to Geo
   VPN. With this capability, VPN gateway in Azure and GCloud can be
   included as part of Geo VPN solution.

-  Support gateway resizing without a need to terminate the old gateway
   and create a new one. This feature is available for AWS, Azure
   Classic, Azure ARM and GCloud but only on gateways without ELBs. To
   configure, go to Gateway, select the target gateway and desired size
   from "Gateway Size" dropdown list", click Change button.

-  Support an option to select subnet/availability zone when enabling HA
   for AWS. To configure, go to Gateway, select the target gateway and
   the desired subnet from "Backup Gateway Subnet" dropdown list, click
   "Enable HA" button.

-  Support an option to select ELB name when editing VPN gateway
   configuration. This feature is useful for GCloud network, which may
   have multiple ELBs, each in a different subnet. To configure, go to
   Advanced Config -> Edit Config and select the ELB from "LB Name"
   dropdown list.

-  Support to map multiple real CIDRs to multiple virtual CIDRs for
   site2cloud connection "mapped" connection. The multiple CIDRs need to
   be separated by a comma. The numbers and masks of the real CIDRs and
   corresponding virtual CIDRs must match each other.

-  A new Aviatrix IAM custom policy is provided with more restrictive
   rules and some additional rules to support role-based IAM.

UserConnect-063016
==================

-  GUI 2.0 for preview. To access GUI 2.0, go to
   https://controller_ip/preview/. Note: Old GUI is still available at
   https://controller_ip. GUI 2.0 doesn't support all the features
   available at the old GUI at this time.

-  Note: GUI 2.0 requires the controller to run on a instance with at
   least 4GB of memory. If your current controller does not meet this
   requirement, follow the procedure below:

   -  AWS controller: stop the controller instance, change instance type
      to t2.medium or larger, start the controller instance again.

   -  Azure Classic and Azure ARM controller: you can change the
      instance dynamically to at least D2 without stopping the instance
      first.

   -  Google Controller: stop the controller instance, change instance
      type to n1-standard-2, start the controller instance again.

-  Support site2cloud connection between customer network and cloud
   network where the two sides may have overlapping CIDRs. Only GUI 2.0
   support this feature. To configure, select "Mapped" for "Connection
   Type" and assign different virtual subnets to both customer network
   and cloud network.

-  GUI 2.0 dashboard displays IPSec tunnel status and link latency of an
   encrypted peering. When IPSec tunnel status of an encrypted peering
   flips between up and down, an email notification will be sent to the
   admin.

-  GUI 2.0 displays all VPN users added to the controller without
   selecting VPC ID/VNet name first. VPN users are sorted alphabetically
   for easy search.

UserConnect-052616
==================

-  Project Skyhook release: Docker swarm cluster container access
   support. From your desktop, you now can access Docker containers in a
   multi-host Docker swarm cluster built on a VXLAN overlay network that
   may span AWS, Azure and Google. To enable this feature, go to
   VPC/VNet -> VPN Access -> Skyhook: Docker Container Access. This
   feature is available on VPN gateways created after upgrade to this
   release. (If you have enabled ELB, delete the existing gateways and
   create new one. VPN user database are not affected.) For reference
   design on how to use this feature to access Docker containers, check
   out `this
   link <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/ContainerAccess.html>`__.
   Key benefits: a) MFA and user profile based access control apply to
   containers in the same manner as for instances. b) use the familiar
   tools such as curl, vim and wget on container without resorting to
   "docker exec" type of commands.

UserConnect-050316
==================

-  Enhance stability, manageability and debug ability for gateway launch
   and encrypted peering functions.

-  Support one load balancer in each different subnet of the same GCloud
   network.

-  Kernel 3.13.0-74 support on new gateway launches.

UserConnect-040316
==================

-  When VPN gateways are behind ELB, allow to import a new CRL URL
   without recreating VPN users/profiles or reissuing VPN certificates.
   To configure, delete all the VPN gateways first and then go to
   VPC/VNet -> VPN Access -> Certificate Management -> Import
   Certificates. Make sure that "CA Certificate", "Server Certificate"
   and "Server Private Key" are the same as before. The new CRL URL can
   be entered in "CRL Distribution Point URI" field. After finishing
   certificate management, recreate the VPN gateways behind ELB.

-  Enhance "Encrypted Peering" by verifying IPSec tunnel connection
   state after creating the peering.

-  Provide "Test HA" function for verifying VPC high availability. To
   test it, go to VPC/VNet -> VPC HA to enable HA for your gateway first
   and then click "Test HA" button to test HA function.

-  Enhance gateway creation by only listing the cloud types enabled in
   cloud accounts.

-  Allow to modify site2cloud connection and configuration template by
   editing “Cloud Networks” or “Customer Networks” CIDRs. To use this
   feature, go to VPC/VNet -> Site2Cloud -> List -> Edit. If changes
   need to be made for subnets/address spaces in VPC/VNet, select “Cloud
   Networks” to enter all VPC/VNet CIDRs. If changes need to be made for
   subnets in on-prem network, select “Customer Networks” to enter all
   on-prem CIDRs. This feature minimizes the configuration changes on
   customer sites by not having to delete the existing site2cloud
   connection.

UserConnect-032516
==================

First release for Azure ARM cloud support. If you currently have
deployments in Azure Classic, we recommend you skip this release. Azure
ARM is the new Azure portal that is significantly different in how API
works comparing with Azure Classic.

-  Support launching gateways in Microsoft Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
   VNet. Follow the embedded Aviatrix’s instructions to collect
   Application Endpoint, Application Client ID and Application Client
   Secret before creating a cloud account. The main feature supported by
   ARM in this release is Site2Cloud. Peering with ARM VNet is not
   supported in this release.

-  Site2Cloud supports to generate a configuration template for generic
   customer gateway devices.

-  Support security patches for both controller and gateways. To apply
   the software patch, go to Setting -> System -> Security Patches. The
   patch available for this release is glibc Vulnerability.

UserConnect-031016

   account is required to launch the gateways in Azure China.

-  Support launching gateways in Amazon AWS GovCloud. AWS GovCloud
   account is required to launch the gateways in AWS GovCloud.

-  Support Site2Cloud null encryption. This feature allows you to create
   an IPSec tunnel without encrypting the packets. To configure, go to
   VPC/VNet -> Site2Cloud -> Add and then select “Null Encryption”.

UserConnect-021516
==================

This release consists of a few significant features: GCloud Support,
Modular Split Tunnel Configuration, Site to Cloud, Encryption for Azure
ExpressRoute, Transitive Peering and VNet route diagnostics, as
described below:

-  Support Google Cloud (GCloud). The following major functions are
   available on GCloud for this release:

   -  Launch an Aviatrix Controller from GCloud directly. Follow `the
      instructions <http://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/google-aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`__
      to do so.

   -  From AWS/Azure/GCloud controller, you can now launch a gateway in
      GCloud.

   -  GCloud account creation, editing and deletion

   -  Multiple GCloud projects support

   -  GCloud gateway (with or without ELB, with or without VPN access)
      creation and deletion

   -  Gateway encrypted peering to other projects in GCloud and with AWS
      VPC and Azure VNets.

   -  Security policies at GCloud network level.

   -  Edit configuration (LDAP, DHCP, and Split Tunnel) on existing
      gateway

-  Support the ability to edit the split tunnel mode on existing VPN
   gateways. Previously, to make any split tunnel related configuration
   changes, users have to delete the existing VPN gateways and re-create
   new ones. With this release, when you add a new VPC/VNet and your VPN
   users need to access them via VPN, you just modify the CIDRs at
   “additional CIDRs” field at split tunnel configuration without
   deleting any existing gateways. To configure, go to VPC/VNet -> Edit
   Configuration-> Modify Split Tunnel. Note all additional CIDRs (the
   CIDRs that are not the VPC/VNet CIDR where VPN gateways are deployed)
   must be entered all together, separated by comma. For example, you
   have two new VPCs, 10.10.0.0/16 and 10.11.0.0/16, and you like to
   access them via split tunnel VPN. You must enter at the Modify Split
   Tunnel field “10.10.0.0/16,10.11.0.0/16” without the quote. In
   addition, you may need to add encrypted peering with the new VPCs in
   order for traffic to go through. The changes are effective
   immediately to the VPN gateway in the VPC/VNet. If there are multiple
   VPN gateways behind a load balancer, they are all updated at the same
   time. Active VPN users will be disconnected during this configuration
   time.

-  Support Transitive Peering. Transitive Peering enables you to route
   traffic from instances in Source VPC, encrypted, through a NextHop
   VPC gateway to reach a destination. Before creating Transitive
   Peering’, you need to make Encrypted Peering between Source VPC and
   NextHop VPC first. To create/delete Transitive Peering, go to
   VPC/VNet -> Encrypted Peering -> Transitive Peering.

-  Support site to cloud IPSec VPN connections. Using this feature, you
   can create IPSec VPN connections linking your on-prem networks to
   VPC/VNets in the cloud. To configure, go to VPC/VNet -> Site2Cloud.
   After adding a site2cloud connection, you can download a
   configuration template file for your on-prem devices (Only Cisco ASA
   configuration template is available now). If High Availability (HA)
   function is enabled, one gateway serves as the primary VPN connection
   endpoint and the other one serves as the backup. In case on-prem
   device loses the VPN connection to the primary VPN gateway, it can
   switch to the backup gateway to recover the VPN connection. Some
   diagnostic tools for site2cloud are also provided.

-  Support encryption for Azure ExpressRoute. This feature allows to run
   IPSec over Azure Express Route to ensure a higher security level. To
   enable it, first launch a gateway in a subnet dedicated for the
   gateway, then go to VPC/VNet -> Site2Cloud, click “Add” tab and
   select “Private Route Encryption”.

-  Support VNet route diagnostics. Go to Settings -> Troubleshooting ->
   VNet Route Diagnostics to find various VNet routing related
   diagnostics tools.

UserConnect-011316
==================

-  Support VPN certificates maintained by a third party PKI system.
   Third party PKI must be created before any gateway launch. To enable
   this feature, go to VPC/VNet -> VPN Access -> Certificate Management.
   Use this feature to import certificates and download VPN
   configuration files.

-  Support the ability to edit the LDAP settings on existing VPN
   gateways. Previously, to make any LDAP related configuration changes,
   users have to delete the existing VPN gateways and re-create new
   ones. With this support, you can enable, disable, or modify LDAP
   configuration on existing VPN gateways without deleting them. To
   configure, go to VPC/VNet -> Edit Configuration-> Modify LDAP
   Configuration.

UserConnect-121015
==================

-  Support remote syslog to a third party or Aviatrix syslog server. The
   feature allows 24x7 premium customer to forward both controller and
   gateway events to a customized Aviatrix syslog server for debugging
   and troubleshooting purpose. This feature improves customers network
   uptime. To enable this feature, go to Settings -> Setup loggings ->
   Remote Syslog.

-  Support the ability to push down to VPN user client the DHCP settings
   made in AWS VPC Console “Create DHCP Options Set” menu. For example,
   if you wish to change DNS name after the gateway has been launched,
   you can use this feature to make changes. The active VPN users will
   be disconnected when this feature is executed. To configure, go to
   VPC/VNet -> Edit Configuration -> Reload DHCP Configuration.

UserConnect-112415
==================

-  Support Sumologic logging collector. When enabled, syslog data from
   the controller and all gateways will be forwarded to a Sumologic
   account. To enable, click Settings -> Setup Loggings -> Sumologic

   session. The log describes the VPN user virtual IP address, source
   port and the destination IP address and port. By correlating with VPN
   username and its assigned virtual IP address, IT admin can uniquely
   track and identify every VPN users’ access activity history to both
   internal resource and external resource.

-  Support multiple users in admin privilege. Support multiple users in
   user account privilege.

UserConnect-092115
==================

-  Added hard token authentication support on DUO security. Made DUO
   authentication configuration optional. When “Token” is configured as
   the Push Mode for all gateways, user must append the 6 digits’ token
   number to their password.

   **Note: **

1. **All active VPN users will be disconnected for this upgrade duo to
   VPN server restart.**

2. **You must log out and log back in again for new features to take
   effect.**

3. **You need to run upgrade command two times.**

-  Support VPN user certificate re-issuing. When existing VPN user
   certificate is re-issued, the current certificate of the user is
   revoked and a new certificate is sent to the user.

-  Active VPN user on dashboard display is dynamically refreshed every 5
   minutes.

UserConnect-082815
==================

-  Support launch gateways in Microsoft Azure.

UserConnect-082515
==================

-  Support backup DUO push. When both LDAP and DUO are enabled, user can
   type #push1 or #push2 appending to the password field to specify
   which phone in the DUO device list to be notified for approval. For
   example, if a user John Smith’s password is johnsmith, he can type at
   password prompt johnsmith#push1 or johnsmith#push2 to specify the
   first phone or the second phone to be notified. If only password is
   typed in, the default phone (the first phone on the device list in
   DUO) will be notified.

   **Note: You must run upgrade command twice to have the upgrade take
   effect for this particular upgrade. All VPN users need to be deleted
   and added again as the existing certificates will not work with the
   new encryption algorithm. The first upgrade command may generate an
   exception, just ignore it and run upgrade again. **

   Suggested upgrade procedure: delete all existing users. Upgrade once
   and upgrade again, and then add users back.
