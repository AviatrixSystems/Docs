Authentication Options 
-----------------------

- **LDAP/AD Integration**  Authenticates VPN user from Aviatrix gateways in addition to VPN certificate authentication.
- **DUO Integration** Authenticates VPN user from Aviatrix gateways in addition to VPN cert authentication.
- **OKTA Integration** Authenticates VPN user from Aviatrix gateways in addition to VPN cert authentication. 
- **MFA Integration** Combines LDAP and DUO for multi-factor authentication.

Scale Out Performance
----------------------

- **TCP-based VPN** For a universal/no firewall/no fuss user VPN solution, use an Aviatrix integrated NLB to load balance multiple Aviatrix VPN gateways. When NLB is used, OpenVPN® client software runs on TCP port 443. TCP-based VPN requires no special corporate firewall rules when VPN client is on-prem.
- **UDP-based VPN**  For a high performance user VPN solution, use Aviatrix integrated AWS Route53 round robin routing to load balance multiple Aviatrix VPN gateways. When Route53 round robin routing is used, OpenVPN® client software runs on UDP port 1193. UDP-based VPN has improved file transfer performance. 
- **Geo VPN** For TCP-based VPN, you can use Aviatrix integrated AWS Route53 latency-based routing to load balance clients residing in different geographic locations.  

Logging Integration
-------------------

- **VPN User** VPN user connection history and bandwidth usage can be logged to Splunk, SumoLogic, ELK, Remote Syslog and DataDog.
- **User Activity** Each VPN user TCP/UDP session can be logged to Splunk, SumoLogic, ELK, Remote Syslog and DataDog.

Client Software
----------------
 
- **OpenVPN® Client Software** All OpenVPN® client software is supported. The supported clients are macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, Chromebook, Linux and BSD. 
- **Aviatrix VPN Client** Aviatrix VPN Client supports macOS, Windows and Linux Debian distribution and BSD distribution. Choose Aviatrix VPN Client if you require SAML authentication directly from VPN client software.
