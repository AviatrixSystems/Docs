=========================================================
Firewall Network (FireNet)  Workflow
=========================================================


1. Create a Security VPC
------------------------------------------------

We recommend you to use the Aviatrix Useful Tool to create a VPC for FireNet deployment. 

Select "Aviatrix Transit VPC" option when creating a security VPC. 

2. Subscribe to AWS Marketplace
--------------------------------------

If you have not already done so, follow the Go link to subscribe the VM-Series in AWS Marketplace.

Do not launch the firewall instance from AWS Console as you launch it in the following steps. . 

3. Create a Firewall Domain
-----------------------------

This step creates a Security Domain with Firewall Domain option. 

Go to TGW Orchestrator -> Plan -> Create a Security Domain to create one as shown below.

4. Launch Aviatrix FireNet Gateway
------------------------------------------

This step leverage the Transit Network workflow to launch one Aviatrix gateway for FireNet deployment. 

The minimum Aviatrix gateway instance size for FireNet deployment is C5.xlarge as it requires `4 interfaces. <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/firewall_network_faq.html#what-is-the-minimum-gateway-instance-size-for-firenet-deployment>`_

If your deployment requires 2-AZ HA, go through Transit Network -> Setup to launch one Aviatrix gateway and enable HA which effectively launches HA gateway (the second gateway) in a different AZ.


5. Enable Aviatrix FireNet Gateway
---------------------------------------------

This step configures the gateway launched in Step 4 for FireNet function. If you have HA enabled, it
automatically sets up the HA gateway for FireNet deployment.

6. Attach Aviatrix FireNet gateway to TGW Firewall Domain
-------------------------------------------------------------

This step requires you have already created a Security Domain with Firewall attribute enabled.


7a. Launch and Associate Firewall Instance
--------------------------------------------

This is recommended approach. 

This step launches a VM-Series and associate it with one of the FireNet gateway. Note the VM-Series and the 
associated FireNet gateway must be in the same AZ.

7a.1 Launch and Associate
##########################

==========================================      ==========
**Setting**                                     **Value**
==========================================      ==========
VPC ID                                          The Security VPC created in Step 1.
Gateway Name                                    The primary FireNet gateway.
Firewall Instance Name                          The name that will be displayed on AWS Console.
Firewall Image                                  The AWS AMI that you have subscribed in Step 2.
Management Interface Subnet.                    Select the subnet whose name contains "gateway and firewall management"
Egress Interface Subnet                         Select the subnet whose name contains "FW-ingress-egress".
Key Pair Name (Optional)                        The .pem file name for SSH access to the firewall instance.
==========================================      ==========

7a.2 Launch and Associate More
#################################

Repeat Step 7a.1 to launch the second firewall instance to associate with the HA FireNet gateway. 
Or repeat this step to launch more firewall instances to associate with either FireNet gateway.

7a.3 Example Setup for "Allow All" Policy
###########################################

After a firewall instance is launched, wait for 15 minutes to come up. 

You can follow `this example configuration guide <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/config_paloaltoVM.html>`_ to build
a simple "Allow All" policy on the firewall instance for a test validation that traffic is indeed being routed
to firewall instance. 


7b. Associate an Existing Firewall Instance
--------------------------------------------

This step is alternative step to Step 7a. If you already launched VM-Series from AWS Console, you can still
associate it with the FireNet gateway. 


8. Specify Security Domain for Firewall Inspection
-----------------------------------------------------

The method to specify a Spoke VPC that needs inspection is to define a connection policy of the Security Domain where the  Spoke VPC is a member to the Firewall Domain.

For example, if you wish to inspect traffic between on-prem to VPC, connect Aviatrix Edge Domain to the 
Firewall Domain. This means on-prem traffic to any Spoke VPC is routed to firewall first and then it is forwarded
to the destination Spoke VPC. Conversely, any Spoke VPC traffic destined to on-prem is routed to firewall first and then forwarded to on-prem.
