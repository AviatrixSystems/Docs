Aviatrix Terraform Tutorial
===========================================================================================

This document will walk you through the steps to set up the Aviatrix Terraform provider. As an example, an Aviatrix gateway will be launched.

.. note::
  Aviatrix is now an official Terraform provider! The Terraform setup procedure has been significantly simplified and the documentation below has been updated accordingly. Customers who have previously set up our provider following our previous instructions may transition to our official provider by following the steps below in Step 5.

1. Download Terraform Package
-------------------------------------

Terraform is delivered as a zip file in binary. Click `here <https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html>`_, select your respective OS and simply download the package as you would for any software.

For Mac, Terraform is also present in `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_. Perform ``brew install terraform`` to install Terraform (Skip step 1.1 if done this way).

Once download is complete, double-click to unzip the file. The executable file ``terraform`` should be in your Downloads folder. (This will be used as an example in this document)


1.1. Setup Execution Path (only when not using package manager)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are running the Terraform binary file after simply downloading it, you will need to execute it using the full path.

Assuming it's downloaded into your ``$HOME/Downloads`` directory, run:

::

  $ ~/Downloads/terraform

1.2 Verify Terraform Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In your Terminal, run ``terraform`` to verify Terraform has been successfully been installed.

Please run ``terraform --version`` to verify you have the latest version of Terraform. `As of 22 May 2019 <https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-terraform-0-12>`_ , the latest version of Terraform is **0.12.x**.

For Windows, the command is ``terraform.exe --version``

2. Prepare Aviatrix Controller
--------------------------------

Follow the `Aviatrix Controller Startup Guide <https://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html>`_ to launch a Controller and go through the Onboarding process.

Once Onboarding is completed, a `primary account <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/onboarding_faq.html#what-is-the-aviatrix-primary-access-account>`_ should be created. This primary account will be used to launch a gateway.


3. Prepare a Terraform Environment (workspace)
----------------------------------------------

While you can run Terraform within any directory, we highly recommend using Terraform/ managing your infrastructure in an isolated environment. That can be achieved as simply as creating a separate directory to use and running ``terraform init`` within the directory.

Example for Unix/Linux:

::

  $ mkdir terraform-test-environment
  $ cd terraform-test-environment
  $ terraform init


``terraform init`` will initialise the current directory into a working directory for Terraform. In the future, whenever a new Terraform configuration is written, or if a provider is updated, this command must be run again.

Next, create a Terraform configuration file. For each Terraform environment, a provider must be specified; in this case, we will use Aviatrix.

.. note::
  While it is possible to manage an entire infrastructure within one Terraform file, we recommend decoupling based on infrastructure. For example, a VPN setup can be in one Terraform file, under one directory, a transit-network can be in another.

For this below example, we can create a test gateway. In this file "aviatrix_gateway_test.tf", copy and paste
the below text. Be sure to modify the parameters to suit your environment accordingly.

::

  # Specify Aviatrix as the provider with these parameters:
  # controller_ip - public IP address of the controller
  # username - login user name, default is admin
  # password - password
  # version - release version # of Aviatrix Terraform provider

  provider "aviatrix" {
      controller_ip = "35.5.26.157"
      username = "admin"
      password = "ControllerPSWD#"
      version = "2.2"
  }

  # Launch a gateway with these parameters:
  # cloud_type - Enter 1 for AWS
  # account_name - Aviatrix account name to launch GW with
  # gw_name - Name of gateway
  # vpc_id - AWS VPC ID
  # vpc_reg - AWS VPC region
  # gw_size - Gateway instance size
  # subnet - VPC subnet CIDR where you want to launch GW instance

  resource "aviatrix_gateway" "testGW" {
      account_name = "for-create2"
      cloud_type = 1
      gw_name = "testGW1"
      vpc_id = "vpc-01dd5643eca66486c"
      vpc_reg = "us-west-2"
      gw_size = "t2.micro"
      subnet = "172.34.0.0/24"
  }


4. Run the Terraform Configuration
-----------------------------------

In the directory where the Terraform configuration file resides, run the ``terraform init`` command to prepare the new configuration file.

::

  $ terraform init

Then run the ``terraform plan`` command to see what will be executed.

::

  $ terraform plan

Finally, run the ``terraform apply`` command to launch the gateway.

::

  $ terraform apply

When the above command finishes, you can login to your Aviatrix Controller console, navigate to the Gateway page and see that the new gateway with the name "testGW1" has been successfully launched.


5. Troubleshooting
--------------------------

5.1 Simple debugging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A simple Terraform debug method is to set TF_LOG level in ~/.bash_profile, as shown in the below example (Remember to run command ``source ~/.bash_profile`` after editing .bash_profile):

::

  export TF_LOG=TRACE

With this log set to TRACE, you should see TRACE and ERROR when running Terraform commands. Pay attention to ERRORs if a Terraform command is not successful.

5.2 Transitioning to Official Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our Aviatrix Terraform provider is now an official Terraform provider and as such, future releases will no longer be updated at the AviatrixSystems Github repo; it will be available through Hashicorp directly.

This change means that current customers will no longer be required to manually use Git to pull changes locally and then run Go to build the provider. Future customers will also be saved the hassle of the previous setup procedure.

For customers who previously set up the Aviatrix Terraform provider prior to the official release on Hashicorp, the transition procedure is relatively simple.

1. Remove the ``.terraformrc`` created to previously link Terraform to the filepath of the local provider to build/ comment out the "aviatrix" providers block within the file
  * For Linux/ Unix, it should be the ``~/.terraformrc``
  * For Windows, the file should be at ``%APPDATA%\terraform.rc``
2. In your Terraform environment where the **provider** block is written, specify the version provider you would like to use (see below for example)
  * Please note that the ``version`` refers to the Aviatrix Terraform release number. Refer to our `provider release notes <https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aviatrix/releases>`_

Please also note that previously, customers were to match and build the branch of the provider corresponding to the Controller version. Now, customers should use whichever latest ``version`` is compatible with their Controller.

* **EXCEPTION: For customers on Controller 4.7.x, please note there are multiple releases to support various configurations:**

  * Controller 4.7.x , Terraform v0.11: Use **Release 1.15**
  * Controller 4.7.x , Terraform v0.12: Use **Release 1.16**

* **NOTE: For Release 2.0, there is major code restructuring and changes. Please follow Recommendations below before switching to Release 2.0+ if coming from releases prior/ Controller <4.7**

  * Controller 4.7.x , Terraform v0.12: Use **Release 2.2**

::

  provider "aviatrix" {
      controller_ip = "1.2.3.4"
      username = "admin"
      password = "password"
      version = "2.2" # specify a Release version as shown on this line
  }

  ...

Recommendation:
***************
For customers on Controller 4.7 or looking to upgrade to 4.7, please refer to our `Upgrade Guide <https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aviatrix/guides/v2-upgrade-guide.html>`_ before attempting to immediately switch to our official provider, especially if you are on Controller 4.7.

  * `Feature Changelist for R2.x <https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aviatrix/guides/feature-changelist-v2.html>`_: tracks customer-impacting changes to Terraform environment for R2.x

If you have any questions, or would require assistance for the upgrade process, please feel free to send an email to support@aviatrix.com.
