Create a VPC
###################################

Use this tool to create a `VPC <https://www.aviatrix.com/learning/glossary/vpc.php>`_ that consists of a public subnet and a private subnet in two AZs and an IGW in the region and account of your choice. 

The VPC CIDR range is from /16 to /24. The VPC name cannot contain underscore character ("_"). 

Go to Useful Tools at the main navigation on the left panel, select Create a VPC -> +Create.

.. tip::

  Select the option Aviatrix Transit VPC if you deploy the Next Gen Transit Network. All necessary subnets and route tables will be fully populated. 
 
Aviatrix Transit VPC

When the "Aviatrix Transit VPC" option is selected, Create a VPC creates the following AWS VPC subnets.

==========================================      ===================
**Subnet name**                                 **Suggested usage**
==========================================      ===================
Public-gateway-and-firewall-mgmt-az1            Use this subnet to launch Aviatrix primary transit gateway.Use this subnet to launch firewall instance in DMZ deployment. 
Public-gateway-and-firewall-mgmt-az2            Use this subnet to launch backup Aviatrix transit gateway. Use this subnet to launch backup firewall instance in a second availability zone in DMZ deployment.
Private-FW-north-az1                            Use this subnet to create an interface on primary firewall instance that interacts with Aviatrix Main gateway in DMZ deployment.
Private-FW-north-az2                            Use this subnet to create an interface on backup firewall instance that interacts with Aviatrix Main gateway in DMZ deployment.
Private-FW-sorth-az1                            Use this subnet to create an interface on primary firewall instance that interacts with Aviatrix Companion gateway in DMZ deployment.
Private-FW-sorth-az2                            Use this subnet to create an interface on backup firewall instance that interacts with Aviatrix Companion gateway in DMZ deployment.
Private-FW-ingress-egress-az1                   Use this subnet to create an interface on primary firewall instance handles ingress and egress traffic in DMZ deployment.
Private-FW-ingress-egress-az2                   Use this subnet to create an interface on backup firewall instance handles ingress and egress traffic in DMZ deployment.
