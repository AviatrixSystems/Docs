2. Create API Administrator Role Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 a. Create a new role profile and name it Aviatrix-API-Role: Go to Device -> Admin Roles -> +Add
 #. Click XML/REST API
 #. Click Report, Configuration, Operation Requests and Commit
 #. Click Commit.

|pan_role_profile|


3. Add an Administrator for API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the VM-Series Console, go to Device -> Administrators -> +Add, to add an administrator for Role Based access as
shown below. Use the profile created in previous step. Remember to click Commit.

|pan_admin|


5. Configure on the Aviatrix Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5.1 Managing VM-Series Directly
----------------------------------

Login to the Aviatrix Controller, go to Firewall Network -> Vendor Integration -> Firewall. Configure the following parameters and click Save.

==========================================      ==========
**Setting**                                     **Value**
==========================================      ==========
FireNet VPC ID                                  The FireNet VPC ID for the Firewall Network deployment.
Firewall instance ID                            The firewall EC2 instance ID. Aviatrix Controller monitors the health of this instance and determines fail over when it becomes unreachable.
Firewall Name (Optional)                        A name to remember.
Firewall Vendor Type                            Select PAN
Firewall Login User Name                        firewall login name for API calls from the Controller. For example, admin-api, as shown in the screen shot.
Firewall Login Password                         firewall login password for API calls.
Firewall Management IP Address                  The public IP address of the firewall management interface for API calls from the Aviatrix Controller
Firewall Virtual Router name (Optional)         Specify the firewall virtual Router name you wish the Controller to program. If left unspecified, the Controller programs the firewall's default router.
==========================================      ==========

5.2 Managing VM-Series by Panorama
------------------------------------

If Panorama is used to manage the VM-Series, any dynamic route updates initiated by Aviatrix Controller are sent to Panorama.

Before you integrate Panorama with the Aviatrix Controller, you need to first launch and configure Panorama. The steps are as follows:

a. Launch Panorama
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Launch Panorama from the AWS portal and SSH in to set the UI password, which is the same as the PAN firewall.

Change the Panorama management interface security group to allow port 3978. This is the port used by Panorama and the firewall to exchange information.

Install a license in Panorama. Without the correct license, it won't work.

b. Upgrade Panorama 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Panorama must be on the same or higher software version as its managed firewalls.

Currently (Dec., 2019), a newly launched firewall instance is on version 9.0.3.xfr.  If the Panorama instance version is on 8.1.x, upgrade it to version 9.0.3.xfr or higher version by following the instructions below.

Go to Panorama --> Dynamic Updates, click "Check Now", select the latest version in "Applications and Threats", download and install.

Go to Panorama --> Software, select the desired version, download and install. After installation, Panorama will reboot. This will take a few minutes.

c. Create Templates and Template Stack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Template and template stack are used to configure Network properties, such as interfaces, zones, and route tables. This is the one that we need to monitor and update through API.

 1. **Create Template**
      You should create a template for each firewall group: One for the FireNet primary gateway and one for FireNet backup gateway.

 #. **Configure Template**
      Add interfaces (ethernet1/1, ethernet1/2), zones (LAN, WAN), and Virtual Routers (route tables). Do not name the route table as "default" since this may conflict with the firewall's default route table.  Please refer to the step 7 and 10 of  https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/config_paloaltoVM.html

 #. **Create Template Stack**
      A Template stack is a bundle to bound templates with managed devices. When creating, select template(s) and devices.  Create one template stack for the primary FireNet gateway, another for backup FireNet gateway. Remember the template stack name. Commit and push.

d. Create Device Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Device Group is used to manage all the firewall policies.

 1. **Add Device Group**
      Go to Panorama --> Device Groups, click "Add" to create two new device groups for FireNet GW HA. Add managed VMs to each device group. Remember the device group name, for example "west2-firenet-primary".

The following 3 # steps, please refer to the step 8 and 9 of https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/config_paloaltoVM.html
 #. **Add Example Policy** (Optional if internet traffic is needed) 
      Add "Outbound" policy to the just created device group.

 #. **Add Egress Policy** (Optional)
      If you plan to deploy Egress inspection, add source-nat and security outbound rule policies

 #. **Commit The Change**
       Commit and push.
  
After the above steps, once M-Series instances are added to Panorama, all configuration should be done through the Panorama console.

e. Create admin role and user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the same as for individually managed VM-Series. Create an admin role with XML API permission and create an admin user with the admin role.

After you have set up and configured your Panorama, go to the Aviatrix Controller -> Firewall Network -> Vendor Integration -> Firewall Manager (Panorama) and configure the following.

==========================================      ==========
**Setting**                                     **Value**
==========================================      ==========
FireNet VPC ID                                  The FireNet VPC ID for the Firewall Network deployment.
FireNet Gateway                                 The FireNet gateway name.
Vendor Type                                     Select Palo Alto Panorama.
Management IP Address                           The public IP address of the Panorama instance.
Login User Name                                 Panorama login name for API calls from the Controller. For example, admin-api, as shown in the screen shot.
Login Password                                  Panorama login password for API calls.
Template Name                                   Panorama template for each FireNet gateway. (If FireNet gateway HA is configured, there should be two templates)
Template Stack Name                             Panorama template stack for each FireNet gateway.((If FireNet gateway HA is configured, there should be two template stacks)
Router name (Optional)                          Specify the firewall virtual Router name you wish the Controller to program. If left unspecified, the Controller programs the Panorama template's first router.
==========================================      ==========

.. Note::

    - The Panorama manager needs to be configured separately for the primary and backup FireNet gateways, because each is associated with a different template name.  

    - Panorama can be configured even when there is no VM-Series associated with a FireNet gateway. However in such case, the egress subnet is not decided, therefore the egress route cannot be added. Once the first VM-Series instance is launched and is in sync with Panorama, the egress route will be automatically added.

    - If any VM-Series for a FireNet gateway is already managed by the Controller, you need to remove that configuration before configuring Panorama. See the migration instructions in the next section. 

    - After Panorama is setup, any additional VM-Series associated with same gateway will be controlled by Panorama and no further configuration on the VM-Series is needed.

    - When all VM-Series are disassociated from a FireNet gateway, Panorama still maintains the configuration, unless the user removes the configuration from Panorama.

    - When Panorama is configured, the associated  will show the vendor as "Palo Alto Panorama". Clicking "Show" will use the same access account and password to access firewall and retrieve route information.  To enable this, you need to configure admin role and user (same name and password as configured for Panorama itself) in the template in Panorama.

Migrating from individually VM to Panorama
#################################################################

Assuming you have existing individually managed VM-Series by the Aviatrix Controller and have prepared your Panorama, follow the instructions below to migrate individually VM to Panorama.. 

a. Remove firewall integration as PAN 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If any firewall for a FireNet gateway is already integrated with the Controller with PAN as the Vendor type, you need to remove that configuration. 

To do so, go to Controller->Firewall Network->Vendor Integration->Firewall, select the Transit VPC ID, Firewall Instance ID. For the Firewall Vendor Type, select "Generic". This effectively removes the Controller integration. 

b. Remove firewall configuration (if this is a new VM, skip this step)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From your firewall console, remove interfaces, zone, virtual router, policies, api admin role and api administrator.

c. Add Firewall to Panorama
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Refer to HOW TO ADD A LOCALLY MANAGED FIREWALL TO PANORAMA MANAGEMENT, https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000CloRCAS

  1. Add the firewall to the panorama managed devices list. Log into Panorama, select Panorama > Managed Devices and click Add. Enter the serial number of the firewall and click OK. Commit. For the Commit Type select Panorama, and click Commit again.
  2. Set up a connection from the firewall to Panorama. Log in to the firewall, select Device > Setup, and edit the Panorama Settings. In the Panorama Servers fields, enter the IP addresses of the Panorama management server. Click OK and Commit.
  3.  Make any necessary configuration changes and commit your changes to the VMs. Click Commit and for the Commit Type select Device Group. Select Merge with Device Candidate Config,select the 'Include Device and Network Templates' check box, and click Commit. 

  4.  Go back to Panorama --> Managed Devices --> Summary, check the device should show "Connected".
  
 
Port 3978 also needs to be allowed on the firewall side. After 4.7, newly launched firewalls through the AVX controller will handle this, but for existing firewalls, the user need to do it by himself/herself.


d. Add device into desired template stack and Device Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to Panorama --> Template, select the desired template stack and check the firewall from the device list.

Go to Panorama --> Device Group, select the desired group and check the firewall from the device list.

Commit and push.

e. Integrate Panorama with Aviatrix Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the Aviatrix Controller->Firewall Network->Vendor Integration->Firewall Manager (Panorama), fill out all the required information and save.

This step can also be done right after step a.


4. API calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The integrated functions by the Controller are the following:

 - The Controller monitors the health of Palo Alto Network software by using the VM-series API and performs switch over based on the API return status.
 - The Controller dynamically programs Palo Alto Network route tables for any new propagated new routes discovered both from new Spoke VPCs and new on-premise routes.

Examples of Palo Alto Networks API used:

1. get key:
