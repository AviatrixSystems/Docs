Overview
--------
This document describes how to configure an IPsec tunnel between an Aviatrix Gateway and another Aviatrix Gateway using Aviatrix Site2Cloud.

.. note::
   There are only a couple of reasons to use Site2Cloud when connecting two Aviatrix Gateways:

   #. You have overlapping CIDR blocks but need to peer two VPCs
   #. The two Aviatrix Gateways are not part of the same Controller (i.e., one is at your customer and the other one is in your environment)

   If you don't have one of these use cases, you can likely use Aviatrix Encrypted Peering

Deployment Guide
----------------

There are two Aviatrix Gateways for this scenario.  Since you are using the Site2Cloud feature, you must configure each side of the tunnel individually.

We will refer to the gateways below as **Gateway A** and **Gateway B**.  You can pick either gateway to be **Gateway A** or **Gateway B**.

Configure Tunnel from Gateway A to Gateway B

#. Once complete, select the newly created tunnel in the list
#. Select **Aviatrix** for `Vendor`, **UCC** for `Platform` and **1.0** for `Software`.
#. Click **Download Configuration**.  You will use this file to create the other side of the tunnel.

#. Click the **Import** button
#. Select the file downloaded in the previous section
#. Check the values that are pre-populated
#. Click **OK**

Test

Once complete, test the communication using the tunnel

Troubleshooting
---------------

Wait 2-3 minutes for the tunnel to come up.  If it does not come up within that time, check the IP addresses to confirm they are accurate.  Additional troubleshooting is available in the **Diagnostics** tab.
