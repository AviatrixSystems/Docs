 Egress Control Filter
=================================

For questions, check out `Egress FQDN FAQ <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/fqdn_faq.html>`_ or learn more about `FQDN here <https://www.aviatrix.com/learning/glossary/fqdn.php>`_.


Configuration Workflow
======================

.. tip ::

 The instructions below assume there is already an Aviatrix gateway running in the VPC where you wish to deploy FQDN filter. If not, follow the Egress Control workflow to first launch a gateway.

Step 1. Add a new tag
---------------------

Go Security -> Egress Control and click New Tag, as shown below:

|fqdn-new-tag|

Click "+ New Tag", and enter a name for the tag, for example, prod-whitelist, as shown below:

|fqdn-add-new-tag|

Step 2. Add URL list to the new tag
-----------------------------------

Enable the new tag and click Edit, as shown below:

|fqdn-enable-edit|

Click "+ Add New" to add each URL, wild card is allowed for HTTP/HTTPS (TCP 443), as shown below.
(Action "Update" means to save the rules in the tag and if gateways are attached to the tag, "Update" applies the rules to the gateways.)

|fqdn-add-domain-names|

Step 3. Attach to gateways
---------------------------

Click "Attach Gateway" to attach a gateway to the tag.

When a gateway is attached to a tag, in the tag will be pushed for
enforcement (whitelist or blacklist), as shown below:

|fqdn-attach-spoke1|

Repeat Step 3 if you have more gateways that should be attached to this tag.

|fqdn-attach-spoke2|

Add more tags
-------------

Repeat from Step 1 to create more tags and attach them to the same gateway or different gateways.
However, if multiple tags are attached to the same gateway, then the mode (Whitelist or BlackList) must be identical.


Exception Rule
===============

Exception Rule is a system-wide mode.

By default, the Exception Rule is enabled. (The Exception rule box should be checked.)

|exception_rule|

When Exception Rule is enabled, packets passing through the gateway without an SNI field are
allowed to pass. This usually happens when an application uses hard-coded destination
IP address for HTTPS connection instead of domain names.

When Exception Rule is disabled (uncheck the box), packets passing through the gateway without SNI field
are dropped unless the specific destination IP address of the
packet is listed in the Whitelist. The use case could be that certain old applications use
hard coded destination IP address to access external services.


Export
==============

This feature is available in Release 3.4 and later.

Export allows you to download the configured FQDN rules on a per tag bases,
in a human-readable text file format, as shown in the example below:

|export|

Import
========

This feature is available in Release 3.4 and later.

Import allows you to upload a text file that contains FQDN rules to a specific tag.
The text file can be:

 1. The downloaded file from `FQDN Discovery <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/fqdn_discovery.html>`_
 #. The download file from Export from a different tag.
 #. A text file in the format compatible to Export.

Edit Source
==============

Edit Source is available in Release 4.0 and later.

Edit Source allows you to control which source IP in the VPC is qualified for a specific tag. The source IP
can be a subnet CIDR or host IP addresses. This provides fine-grained configuration.

For example, one use case is if you have two private subnets in a VPC: one deploys dev instances and another
deploys prod instances. With Edit Source feature, the dev instances can have a different tags than
the prod instances.

Edit Source assumes you already attached a gateway to a tag.

To go to the Edit Source page, click "Edit Source" at Egress FQDN Filter on a specific tag and follow
the example in the illustration below:

|source-edit|
