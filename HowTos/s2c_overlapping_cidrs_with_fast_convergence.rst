Tuning For Sub-10 Seconds Failover Time in Overlapping Networks
===========================================================================================

Introduction
--------------

The purpose of this document is to provide the instructions for tuning network configurations for sub-10 seconds failover time when 
network address ranges on-prem and cloud are overlapping.

The scenario is described in the following diagram:

|s2c_overlapping_cidr_topology|

In the above diagram, Client-1 and Client-2 need to communicate with on-prem network. However, both Client-1 and Client-2 network 
address ranges overlap with each other, and worse yet, they both overlap with on-prem network address range (10.0.0.0/16). Such scenarios
happen when Client-1, Client-2 and the on-prem networks belong to three different organizations. 

The traditional solution is to build IPSEC tunnel between the two networks and use SNAT/DNAT rules to translate each addresses, as
demonstrated in this `example. <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/connect_overlap_cidrs.html>`_. Such solution requires a potentially
large number of SNAT/DNAT rules which is difficult to configure and maintain.

With the introduction of `Mapped Site2Cloud for address overlapping networks <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/overlapping_network_solutions.html>`_ , you no longer need to wrestle with the individual SNAT/DNAT rules. 


Configuration Steps
----------------------------

.. note::
    This example uses Aviatrix Gateway on client site to simulate fast convergence environment

Step 1: Follow the Multi-Cloud Transit workflow to launch gateways
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log in to the Controller console, go to Multi-CLOUD TRANSIT. Follow step 1, step 4 and step 6 respectively to launch transit and spoke gateways, and attach spoke gateways to transit.

Create VPN tunnel between Transit Gateway and On-prem.

Step 2: Create a Site2Cloud tunnel between Spoke Gateway and Client-1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.1 Configure S2C from Spoke Gateway to Client-1

3) Active Active HA is disabled
4) Event Triggered HA is enabled


Test site2cloud fast convergence
------------------------------------

Bring down IPSec primary tunnel and measure convergence.

Done.
