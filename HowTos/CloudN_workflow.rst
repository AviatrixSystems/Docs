Managed CloudN Workflows
===============================================

Introduction
============

Aviatrix CloudN hardware appliance is deployed on-prem to connect to public cloud. It provides up to 25Gbps encryption performance over AWS Direct Connect and Azure Express Route.

Aviatrix Managed CloudN enables you to manage CloudN hardware appliances by Aviatrix Controller as an `Aviatrix CloudWAN device <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/cloud_wan_faq.html>`_. 

Benefits:
---------

- Ease of use:

	- Centrally manage all CloudN appliances from Aviatrix Controller without logging into each Standalone CloudN GUI individually for ongoing configuration and operation actions.

	- Simplifying connection configuration by removing manually importing S2C IPsec configuration method as in Standalone CloudN.

- Enhanced visibility and troubleshooting:

	- Perform running diagnostics, upload tracelog and upgrade on Managed CloudN device the same way as an Aviatrix gateway. 

	- Support backup/restore function
	
- Active Mesh support:
	
	-  Managed CloudN automatically load balance traffic to both Aviatrix Transit primary gateway and backup gateway
	
- Scalability:

	- Support scale-out fashion to achieve higher IPsec throughput
	
.. note::

	- Managed CloudN only supports High-Performance (Insane Mode) encryption connection. It works with Aviatrix Transit Gateways with Insane Mode enabled.
	
	- This solution applies to over AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute and Internet.
	
	- This solution applies to over GCP InterConnect starting from 6.3. 
	
	- This solution in GCP supports only one tunnel per transit gateway for over Internet scenario.

Prerequisite
====================

Step 1.1 Order CloudN appliance
---------------------------------

`Order a CloudN appliance  <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_insane_mode.html#step-2-pre-deployment-request-form>`_ and install it properly in your data center or data center provider

Step 1.2 (Optional) FQDN name for Controller
-----------------------------------------------

Create and register an FQDN Name for Aviatrix Controller public IP. This is useful if Controller has HA configured. 


Step 1.3 (Optional) Remove the current connection
-----------------------------------------------------

Skip if this is a brand new deployment) Remove/delete any Site2Cloud (IPsec) connection between Aviatrix Transit gateway and Standalone CloudN if you have any in your existing Standalone CloudN deployment 

Step 1.4 Upgrade to the latest
---------------------------------

`Upgrade <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html>`_ Aviatrix Controller to at least version 6.2

Step 1.5 Deploy VPCs, Aviatrix Multi-Cloud Transit Gateways, and Spoke Gateways
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deploy Aviatrix Multi-Cloud Transit solution in the cloud.

	- Follow this `step <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html#launch-a-transit-gateway>`_ to launch Aviatrix Transit gateway with insane mode enabled. Recommended minimum size for Transit in AWS is c5n.4xlarge. Please refer to this `doc <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/insane_mode_perf.html>`_ for performance detail.
	
	- (Optional) Follow this `step <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html#launch-a-spoke-gateway>`_ to launch Aviatrix Spoke gateway with insane mode enabled. Recommended minimum size for Spoke with insane mode in AWS is c5.2xlarge. Please refer to this `doc <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/insane_mode_perf.html>`_ for performance detail. Notes: Users has option to attach non-insane mode Spoke gateway to insane mode Transit gateway.
	
	- (Optional) Follow this `step <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html#join-a-spoke-gw-to-transit-gw-group>`_ to attach Aviatrix Spoke gateway to Aviatrix Transit gateway
	

.. note::
	
	In this example, Aviatrix Multi-Cloud Transit Gateway and Aviatrix Spoke Gateway with HPE are deployed in AWS platform. The workflow applies to Azure. 


Workflow on Aviatrix CloudN
=============================

Step 2.1 Open Controller inbound ports
--------------------------------------

CloudN is deployed inside a data center, it does not require any public IP addressees. However you need to collect the public IP for 
the management interface (The ISP provided pubic IP) and open port 443 on the Controller for that public IP.  

Update Aviatrix Controller's inbound security group to allow TCP 443 from public IP address of the router of CloudN's MGMT interface

	- Open a browser

	- Navigate to the AWS portal

	- Sign in with AWS account
	
	- Find the security group which is associated with Aviatrix Controller
	
	- Configure inbound rule to allow TCP 443 from public IP address provided by the ISP where CloudN's management interface egresses to Internet.  

	.. important::

		This public IP address needs to be static.  

Step 2.2 Configure NTP Sync and SMTP Services
---------------------------------------------

	- Add a firewall rule to allow CloudN’s MGMT outbound UDP port 123 access to ntp.ubuntu.com or to a local NTP server.

	- From the CloudN UI, go to Setting -> Controller -> System Time. Enter ntp.ubuntu.com or a local NTP server then select the Sync option.

	- Do a manual sync to the NTP server.

	- From the CloudN UI, go to Setting -> Controller -> Email, Setup SMTP settings to allow CloudN to send alert email.

Step 2.3 Login CloudN GUI
--------------------------

	- Open a browser
	
	- Navigate to the CloudN GUI with CloudN domain name/IP and port 443
	
	- Sign in with CloudN login credentials
	
Step 2.4 (Optional) Check whether CloudN requires a Controller IP migration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a rare case. It is documented here for completeness. Skip if the Controller IP address has not been changed. 

	- Navigate to the page "Troubleshoot -> Diagnostics -> Network"
	
	- Find the panel `CONTROLLER PUBLIC IP <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Troubleshoot_Diagnostics.html#controller-public-ip>`_
	
	- Perform function `CONTROLLER IP MIGRATION <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/Troubleshoot_Diagnostics.html#controller-ip-migration>`_ if the message in the panel "CONTROLLER PUBLIC IP" guides users to execute it.
	
	.. note::
	
		For private link connectivity such as AWS Direct Connect or Azure Express Route case, CloudN WAN interface is assigned a private IP, thus the message in the panel "CONTROLLER PUBLIC IP" displays "The public IP of this controller is NA. Controller was not able to reach www.carmelonetworks.com through the WAN interface(eth0)."

Step 2.5 Managed CloudN management port outbound access
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manged CloudN (registered to the Controller) management port requires the following Internet egress access. 

	==============================  ================  ==== =================================================
	FQDN                            IP address        PORT Purpose
	==============================  ================  ==== =================================================
	security.aviatrix.com           54.149.28.255     443  Sync service certificates
	diag.aviatrix.com (optional)    54.200.59.112     443  Allow Remote Support access to the CloudN 
	[AVIATRIX CONTROLLER]                             443  Communicate to Aviatrix Controller and receive software upgrades from Controller
	==============================  ================  ==== =================================================
	
Standalone CloudN (de-registered from the Controller) management port requires the following Internet egress access.

        =======================  ================  ==== =================================================
        FQDN                     IP address        PORT Purpose
        =======================  ================  ==== =================================================
        security.aviatrix.com    54.149.28.255     443  Sync service certificates
        diag.aviatrix.com        54.200.59.112     443  Upload tracelog to Aviatrix and remote debugging
        release.aviatrix.com     54.149.28.255     443  Download software for upgrading CloudN
        =======================  ================  ==== =================================================

Upgrade
=======

When an  CloudN registers with an Aviatrix Controller properly as a Managed CloudN device, the upgrade process on the Managed CloudN device is treated the same way 
as an Aviatrix gateway in the cloud when Aviatrix Controller is upgraded. Please refer to `Inline Software Upgrade doc <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html>`_ for upgrading a Managed CloudN device from Aviatrix Controller.

.. important::
	
	* Once CloudN is registered to Aviatrix controller, if you wish to check the version of Managed-CloudNs, please go to Aviatrix controller -> Settings -> Maintenance -> Upgrade -> Gateway Upgrade Status. However, the software version you see from CloudN GUI locally would not change, and it stays with the version at the time when you register CloudN to Aviatrix controller.
	
	* With Managed CloudN, software upgrading directly from CloudN GUI is no longer needed, unless unexpected issues occur. In such case, please open a support ticket at `Aviatrix Support Portal <https://support.aviatrix.com>`_.

User Guide for Redundant DX Deployment
======================================

Active/Active
-------------

|deployment_dual_dx_aa|

The `Active/Active deployment model <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_insane_mode.html#redundant-dx-deployment-active-active>`_ is recommended. In this deployment
model, both CloudN appliances forward traffic and the underlying network links are fully utilized. 

.. important::
	
	Aviatrix topology requirements:
	
		- Attach two CloudN appliances to Aviatrix Transit by following the above workflows.
		
		- Enable `BGP ECMP function <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_advanced.html#bgp-ecmp>`_ on Aviatrix Transit.
		
	On-prem topology requirements:
	
		- If firewalls are deployed, make sure there is no asymmetric routing issues or the firewalls are capable of handling asymmetric routing issues. 
		
		- LAN routers should advertise the same AS path length to both CloudN appliances and enable ECMP feature. 

Active/Standby
--------------

|deployment_dual_dx|

Aviatrix solution supports `Active/Standby deployment model <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_insane_mode.html#redundant-dx-deployment-active-standby>`_, but one of the CloudN appliances and network connections stays at standby/idle mode.

To deploy this topology, on-prem LAN router must advertise **longer BGP AS_PATH** to the Standby CloudN  to ensure traffic direction from cloud to on-prem always routes to the Active CloudN when the connection is up. Once the connection on the Active CloudN is down, traffic will be directed towards the Standby CloudN based on BGP info. When the Active CloudN is recovered, traffic will switch back to the Active CloudN as it has **shorter BGP AS_PATH** length.

Users can utilize `Connection AS Path Prepend <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_advanced.html#connection-as-path-prepend>`_ for the traffic direction from on-prem to cloud depending on requirement.

FAQ
====

Q: What is the terminology of Standalone CloudN and Managed CloudN?

Q: Could a Managed CloudN be converted back to a Standalone CloudN?

Ans: Yes. While this is not recommended practice, you should be able to convert a Managed CloudN device back to a Standalone CloudN by following the `Workflow on cleanup <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_workflow.html#workflow-on-cleanup>`_.

Q: Does Managed CloudN have Aviatrix High-Performance (Insane) mode supported?

Ans: Yes. When a Managed CloudN device attaches to an Aviatrix Transit gateway with HA function enabled, High-Performance (Insane) mode tunnels to both primary and backup transit gateways are built automatically.

Q: Can Managed CloudN solution support Azure Express Route?

Ans: Yes, Managed CloudN runs over Azure Express Route. 

Q: Can we build a mixed topology in the deployment where some connections are from Managed CloudN and others are from Standalone CloudN in one CloudN appliance? 

Ans: No. We don't support this mixed topology. Once you decide to deploy Managed CloudN solution, you need to make sure there is no IPsec tunnel between Aviatrix Transit Gateway and Standalone CloudN before registering the Standalone CloudN to Aviatrix Controller.

Q: Can one Standalone/Managed CloudN appliance connect to multiple links Direct Connect or Express Route?

Ans: Yes. A CloudN appliance can build multiple of HPE connections to different Aviatrix Transit Gateways over multiple Direct Connect or Express Route.

Q: Can one Aviatrix Transit Gateway connect to multiple of Managed CloudNs?

Ans: Yes. An Aviatrix Transit Gateway can build multiple of HPE connections to different Managed CloudNs.

Q: Can one Aviatrix Transit Gateway build mixed connections to different Standalone CloudN and Managed CloudN?

Ans: Yes. While this is not recommended practice, an Aviatrix Transit Gateway is able to build mixed connections to different Standalone CloudN and Managed CloudN. This deployment is for migration stage only.

Q: How to update the new Aviatrix Controller public IP for Managed CloudN?

Ans:

- Refer to `step 2.6 Register with Aviatrix Controller FQDN Name <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_workflow.html#step-2-6-register-with-aviatrix-controller-fqdn-name>`_.

- Navigate to the page "Settings -> Advanced -> Registration" or click the link "Managed CloudN" under UseCases drop down menu on the top on CloudN GUI

- Find the panel "REGISTER CLOUDN AS A GATEWAY"

- Enter the new Aviatrix Controller public IP

	.. important::

		It is highly recommended that a FQDN name is used instead of an IP address for enhanced security and controller HA.

- Click the button "Register"

- Click the button "OK" to confirm

Q: How to migrate a Standalone CloudN to a Managed CloudN?

Ans:

- `Upgrade <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html>`_ Aviatrix Controller and CloudN appliance to at least version 6.2

- Remove/delete any Site2Cloud (IPsec) connection between Aviatrix Transit gateway and Standalone CloudN

- Follow `Workflow on Aviatrix CloudN <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_workflow.html#workflow-on-aviatrix-cloudn>`_

- Follow `Workflow on Aviatrix Controller <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/CloudN_workflow.html#workflow-on-aviatrix-controller>`_
