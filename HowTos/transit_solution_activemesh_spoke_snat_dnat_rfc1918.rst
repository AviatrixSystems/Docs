Aviatrix Active Mesh with customized SNAT and DNAT on spoke gateway
=========================================================================================

The Problem 
------------------

Organizations usually plan out cloud network address ranges for building non-overlapping connectivity to on-prem, 
but there are times where a cloud network CIDR conflicts with an on-prem network address range. Moreover, there might be a 
constraint that neither source NAT nor destination NAT can be performed in the on-prem network but still requires 
connectivity to on-prem. Therefore, how to fulfill source NAT and destination NAT in the cloud becomes a key solution.

Aviatrix Solution
------------------

This technical note illustrates an example solution of performing source NAT and destination NAT feature on Aviatrix spoke 
gateway to a specific use case where a customer needs a connectivity between certain on-prem hosts and certain cloud 
instances, but the on-prem network range overlaps with the cloud network CIDR as shown in the diagram below. 
Additionally, traffic can be initiated from either side.

Topology - Aviatrix Global Transit HA Network with Active Mesh:

|TRANSIT_ACTIVEMESH_SPOKE_OVERLAP_CIDR_TOPOLOGY|

::

    In this example, the on-prem network address range is 10.3.0.0/16 and all other spoke VPCs connect to on-prem via 
    Aviatrix Global Transit HA Network with Active Mesh, however there is one spoke VPC with an identical CIDR of 10.3.0.0/16.

 
.. Note:: 

   This tech note supports:
   
      1. specific on-prem hosts and cloud instances which means no identical IP on each side including IPs of Aviatrix Spoke primary/HA gateway
   
      2. bi-direction traffic
   
      3. both on-prem and cloud network allow only RFC 1918 CIDR

..

Furthermore, this technical note provides a step-by-step configuration on the Aviatrix controller that will address the following requirements:

   1. Deploy `Aviatrix Global Transit HA Network with Active Mesh <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html>`__

   2. Deploy virtual CIDR within RFC 1918 range to solve the overlapping CIDR between on-prem network and cloud network

       - `Customize Advertised Spoke VPC CIDRs <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#customize-advertised-spoke-vpc-cidrs>`__

       - `Destination NAT with Mark and Exclude Route Table	<https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#destination-nat>`__
       
       - `Customized SNAT with Mark and Exclude Route Table <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#customized-snat>`__

Scenario:

    1. Traffic which is initiated from on-prem to cloud spoke network sends to a virtual IP of cloud instance. In addition, cloud instance views a virtual IP of on-prem host.
        
    2. Traffic which is initiated from cloud spoke network to on-prem sends to a virtual IP of on-prem host. In addition, on-prem views a virtual IP of cloud instance.
    
    3. All virtual IPs are belonging to RFC 1918 range.
        
Follow the steps below to set up for the scenario.

Step 1. Prerequisite
-------------------------

1.1. `Upgrade <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html>`__ the Aviatrix Controller to at least version UserConnect-5.4
  
1.2. Prepare a Real/Virtual CIDR mapping table for on-prem network and cloud network

    One of the key steps to solve overlapping network issue is to route a non-overlapping CIDR. Therefore, please prepare 
    a virtual routable CIDR for your on-prem and spoke network. In this example, we practice a Virtual CIDR 
    within RFC 1918 range.

    ::

        Real/Virtual CIDR mapping table example: 

        ==============  ==============  ================
                        Real CIDR       Virtual CIDR
        ==============  ==============  ================
        Spoke VPC       10.3.0.0/16     10.203.0.0/16
        On-Prem VPC     10.3.0.0/16     10.103.0.0/16
        ==============  ==============  ================
        
1.3. Find out the Real IPs of certain on-prem hosts and certain cloud instances to build a Real/Virtual IPs mapping table
    
    Since this solution is to tackle a specific use case where a customer needs a connectivity between certain on-prem hosts 
    and certain cloud instances in overlapping CIDR, please find out those IPs and plan a Real/Virtual IPs mapping table for
    routing advertisement and NAT configuration. 
    
    ::

        Real/Virtual IPs mapping table example:

        ================    ==============  ================
                            Real IP         Virtual IP
        ================    ==============  ================
        Cloud instance      10.3.0.86/32    10.203.0.86/32
        On-Prem host        10.3.0.85/32    10.103.0.85/32
        ================    ==============  ================
  
Step 2. Build Aviatrix Global Transit HA Network with Active Mesh
-------------------------
    
Deploy the topology by following the steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in `document <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html>`__ first

   - make sure `Active Mesh Mode <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html?#activemesh-mode>`__ is enabled on both Aviatrix Transit Gateway and Spoke Gateway

   - make sure HA is deployed for both Aviatrix Transit Gateway and Spoke Gateway

   - make sure on-prem router advertises only the Real IP with /32 of on-prem host not the whole Real CIDR or Virtual IP/CIDR
    
   ::

      Example: on-prem router advertises 10.3.0.85/32 which is the Real IP of On-prem host

Step 3. Perform Customize Spoke Advertised VPC CIDRs feature on Aviatrix Spoke gateway
-------------------------
     
This action is to advertise the Virtual CIDR of cloud spoke network to on-prem via BGP session so that on-prem
is able to route the Virtual IP of Cloud instance. Please refer to this `doc <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/gateway.html#customize-advertised-spoke-vpc-cidrs>`__ 

To configure:

   3.1. Go to the Gateway page, click on the Aviatrix Spoke Gateway first. Click Edit.

   3.2. Continue on to the Edit page, scroll to Customize Spoke Advertised VPC CIDRs.

   3.3. Enter the Virtual CIDR of cloud spoke VPC that on-prem is able to route
   
      - make sure advertise the Virtual CIDR of cloud spoke VPC not the Virtual IP of specific cloud instance

   3.4. Click the button "Save"

   |TRANSIT_ACTIVEMESH_SPOKE_CUSTOMIZED_SPOKE_ADVERTISE_VPC_CIDR|
   
   ::

     Example: Aviatrix Spoke gateway advertises 10.203.0.0/16 which is the Virtual CIDR of cloud spoke VPC

Step 4. Attach Aviatrix Spoke to Aviatrix Transit Network
-------------------------

Follow the `step 6 Join a Spoke GW to Transit GW Group <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitvpc_workflow.html#join-a-spoke-gw-to-transit-gw-group>`__ 
in Global Transit Network Workflow.


Step 5. Configure Aviatrix DNAT function on Aviatrix Spoke Gateway for the traffic which is initiated from on-prem to cloud spoke network

FAQ
------------------

Q1:  Why we need to “mark” the NAT sessions?

Ans: Basically, "mark" function in NAT is a unique number that is associated with specific packets. In this tech note, we leverage on it for the purpose of tracking session identified by the Source CIDR of DNAT and then utilizing it for the SNAT IPs of customized SNAT. It is an advanced option for users to configure NAT rule. Alternatively, users still can configure DNAT and customized SNAT rule without mark.
 
Q2: Why we need to fill all VPC route table IDs for “Exclude Route Table”?

Ans: As Aviatrix Global Transit HA Network design has a mechanism to handle cloud routing table updates, filling all VPC route table IDs for “Exclude Route Table” in NAT feature prevents extra routes to be injected in cloud routing table.
