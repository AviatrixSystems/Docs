Network
---------

This section provides tools to test network connectivity of controller and gateways.

Gateway Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides 3 tools, traceroute, ping and tracepath to test network connectivity for Aviatrix gateways.    


Network Connectivity Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network Connectivity (nc) tool allows you to test if controller/gateway is able to reach a host with specified protocol and port number.


Packet Capture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool enables a gateway to capture the forwarding packets for a period of time with specified host, port, network interface, and packet length.


Controller Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool allows controller to perform a ping test to a specific host in order to run a network connectivity test.


Controller IP Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. important:: User MUST execute this feature after re-associating a new public IP for the controller through AWS/Azure/GCloud GUI console or API. This feature updates the configurations for controller and gateways.
..


Controller Public IP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section displays the current public IP of the controller.

Gateway

Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to `Run diagnostics on a gateway. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/troubleshooting.html>`__


Force Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature allows you to upgrade one particular gateway. A common use case is that during controller upgrade, if an unpredicted network connectivity issue occurs and causes one specific gateway fails to upgrade, then you can simply solve the problem by using this feature.


Service Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section allows you to view the status of the services running on a gateway, such as rsyslog, supervisor BGP service, etc... Furthermore, user can restart a service if there is an indication showing the service might not be working properly.


Keep Gateway on Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, controller will roll back all the operations (gateway, EIP, security-group creations, etc...) if an error occurs during a gateway creation. However, this function allows you to keep the gateway instance for debugging purposes. In another word, this feature disable the roll back operation if the Status is set to True.


Gateway IP Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: User MUST execute this feature after re-associating a new public IP for the gateway through AWS/Azure/GCloud GUI console or API. This feature updates the configurations for controller and gateways.
..


Gateway Replace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature allows you to replace a gateway by launching a new gateway and restore the configuration and operation in the event when gateway becomes not operation and you have exhausted all other ways to recover. Contact support@aviatrix.com 
before you use this feature. 

Select a gateway in the drop down menu and click Replace. 


    Please refer to `Run diagnostics on a gateway. <http://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/troubleshooting.html>`__

Cloud
-------

Account Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature checks if the access accounts have the correct configuration to meet controller's requirements.

.. note:: This operation might take a couple minutes to be finished if you have multiple access accounts. Currently, this feature only supports AWS based access accounts.
..


VPC Diagnostics with Resources Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The diagnostic result of this feature provides the information of specified VPC/VNet, such as DHCP options, Subnets, ACLs, route tables, security groups and VM instances configurations.


VNet Route Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature provides the following operations that can be applied to a VNet:
    1. Display all route tables
    2. Display route table details
    3. Add a route table
    4. Delete a route table
    5. List route table and subnet tables
    6. List effective route of an instance
    7. Add a route in a route table
    8. Delete a route
    9. Turn IP fwd ON
    10. Turn IP fwd OFF
    11. Get IP fwd
    12. Associate a subnet to a route table
    13. Dissociate a subnet from a route table
