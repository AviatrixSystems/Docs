Check Site2Cloud configuration from Aviatrix Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * Check IPSec VPN tunnel configuration detail from Site2Cloud page

      * https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/site2cloud.html#edit-connection
      
      * Steps:
      
         1. Navigate to the Aviatrix GUI page: Site2Cloud
         
         2. Select the connection
         
         3. Click the three bar/hamburger button to view IPSec VPN tunnel detail
      
   * Check IPSec VPN tunnel configuration detail from Download Configuration
   
      * https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/site2cloud.html#download-configuration
      
      * Steps:
         
         1. Navigate to the Aviatrix GUI page: Site2Cloud
         
         2. Select the connection

      * Steps:
         
         1. Navigate to the Aviatrix GUI page: Site2Cloud -> Diagnostics tab
         
         2. Select the related tunnel info for VPC ID/VNet Name, Connection, and Gateway 
         
         3. Select the Action "Show configuration"
         
         4. Click the button "OK"
         
Check IPSec VPN tunnel logs from Site2Cloud Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/site2cloud.html#troubleshooting

   * Steps:

      1. Navigate to the Aviatrix GUI page: Site2Cloud -> Diagnostics tab

      2. Select the related tunnel info for VPC ID/VNet Name, Connection, and Gateway 

      3. Select the Action "Show logs"

      4. Click the button "OK"
      
   Check Point 1: Check whether phase 1 is established
   
      * Expect to view the string "ISAKMP-SA established" in the latest log
     
      * If this string does not show up in the logs, IPSec VPN phase 1 does not establish properly
     
      Probable Causes:
      
         * Aviatrix Gateway cannot reach to the public IP of edge router

         * Edge router cannot process IPSec VPN phase 1 negotiation traffic with port 500

         * Phase 1 configuration on both IPSec VPN devices does not match
      
      Suggestions:
      
         * Check whether edge router can receive traffic from Aviatrix Gateway

            * `T_02. Verify Transport layer by sending traffic with port 500/4500 to the public IP of Edge router from Aviatrix Gateway`_

         * Confirm whether phase 1 configuration is consistent on both edge routers

            * Phase 1 Authentication

            * Phase 1 DH Group

            * Phase 1 Encryption

            * Phase 1 lifetime: 28800

            * Pre-shared Key
      
   Check Point 2: Check whether phase 2 is established
   
      * Expect to view the string "IPsec-SA established" in the latest log
   
      * If this string does not show up in the logs, IPSec VPN phase 2 does not establish properly
     
      Probable Causes:
   
         * Edge router cannot process IPSec VPN phase 2 negotiation traffic with port 4500. Notes: if function nat traversal is enabled, IPSec VPN tunnel uses port 4500.

         * Phase 2 configuration on both IPSec VPN devices does not match
      
      Suggestions:
      
         * Check whether edge router can receive traffic from Aviatrix Gateway

            * `T_02. Verify Transport layer by sending traffic with port 500/4500 to the public IP of Edge router from Aviatrix Gateway`_

         * Confirm whether phase 2 configuration is consistent on both edge routers

            * Phase 2 Authentication

            * Phase 2 DH Group

            * Phase 2 Encryption

            * Phase 2 lifetime: 3600

            * Remote Subnet and Local Subnet
         
   Check Point 3: Check whether message "seems to be dead" displays in the latest log
   
      * Expect not to view this string "seems to be dead" in the latest log
   
      * If this string shows up in the logs, IPSec VPN tunnel might disconnect at some point
     
      Probable Causes:
   
         * DPD configuration does not match on both IPSec VPN devices

         * Phase 1 rekey process somehow behaves anormal
      
      Suggestions:
      
         * Sync up DPD configuration on both IPSec VPN devices

            * interval 10 seconds

            * retry 3 times

            * max failure 3 times

         * or disable DPD function on both IPSec VPN devices
      
   Check Point 4: Check whether phase 2 negotiation uses port 4500
   
      * Expect to view that phase 2 negotiation uses port 4500
   
      * If phase 2 negotiation uses non 4500, it might have a chance to fail IPSec VPN tunnel depending on topology. Notes: if the function nat traversal is enabled, phase 2 negotiation uses port 4500; if the function nat traversal is disabled, phase 2 negotiation uses port 500
     
      Probable Causes:
   
         * user's environment has a NAT device thus the function nat traversal needs to be enabled
      
      Suggestions:
      
         * although the function nat traversal is not necessary to be configured on edge router (it depends on the whole network topology), we highly suggest to configure it since we enable it on Aviatrix Gateway side.
      
Check Aviatrix gateway’s instance level and network level for Site2Cloud feature from AWS portal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Check Point 1: Check the Security Group which is attached to the Aviatrix Gateway

         1. Type: Custom UDP Rule, Protocol: UDP, Port Range: 4500, Source: Custom: 'EDGE ROUTER PUBLIC IP'

         2. Type: Custom UDP Rule. Protocol: UDP, Port Range:  500, Source: Custom: 'EDGE ROUTER PUBLIC IP'

      7. Test port 4500 by following the previous steps 

   * If the testing fails, Aviatrix Gateway might not able to reach to the public IP of Edge router with the specific port 500 or 4500.

   Probable Causes:

    * End device does not allow traffic with port 500 or 4500 from the public IP of Aviatrix Gateway

    * Traffic might be mis-routed or be blocked somewhere
